105905000000,I would definitely recommend this ampoule for anyone. My skin is very dry but will break out from more oily serums. This is perfect for me. Now a permanent staple of my daily routine!This serum has made my skin feel more supple and hydrated. So far Im very happy with this product.Nice texture moisturizees well but the packaging is wasteful weird and awkward. You have to screw the cap all the way back on and wait a minute just to get a second pump. This product rolls a bit when applied over serum.Perfect for my combination skin- Ive always felt something was missing in my routine and this was the product that gave it the extra oomph it needed. Clears up dry patches while not being so heavy as to make my cheeks oily.I put this on my face every night and it is so hydrating. I use to wake up with dried skin but after using this serum my skin is still hydrated in the morning. Absolutely love this!!
105916000000,I like how light and simple this product is. I also like how it doesnt have a strong smell. It leaves my skin pretty hydrated and it also helps when my skin feels tight. Ive used up two bottles of these so far.The packaging is beautiful and it feels really nice and nourishing only been using it for a few weeks so I haven�t noticed any difference in fine lines and wrinkles.I am noticing the wrinkles on my forehead less and less as I use this. Very happy with the results so far Cant wait to see what comes from long time use.Super hydrating genius packaging and absorbs really well! Though unsure if its actually doing anything.Hello holy grail! So I tried this product on a whim and I couldn�t be happier!! First let�s talk product packaging. Holy smokes! This is not only absolutely beautiful it is genius. When you twist off the cap a button pops up and when you take it off SURPRISE its a dropper! Two drops will do y�a a little goes a very long way. The button on top allows for precision amount which is huge for me as I seem to always get too much. Then twist the cap back on and it seals the lid down. Yep! No oxidation happening to this product. Seriously mind blown on this packaging. Never seen anything like it. Next effectiveness. So  only had it for a few days so I Cant comment on the wrinkle reduction BUT what I can say is I have extremely temperamental skin and I have had zero reaction from this. My skin is so incredibly smooth. Like WTF?! So smooth! It does NOT leave a sticky residue and your skin immediately is calm and glows with happiness. I have combination skin and nasty break outs due to hormonal imbalances secondary to PCOS and so far this hasn�t caused any issues which is HUGE for me. I will continue to purchase this product recommend it and will try other products from this line because if the rest of their products are like this one watch out America�s next top model Im coming for you!!....... just kidding I Cant model let�s be real.
260851000000,This is my baseline for combo/dry sensitive skin. My bf and I both use this twice daily. Sometimes I supplement with niacinamide or HA serum but it stands up well on its own. I tend to buy (hoard) multiple tubes at a time.This stuff is awesome for me (dry slightly sensitive skin in my 20s and a bit acne-prone as well). It helps fade scarring marginally faster keeps my skin moisturized and happy in winter and minimizes my acne inflammation. By no means is this a complete substitute for Vitamin C/exfoliants/niacinamide but in my experience it has been a soothing booster to supplement the benefits of my core skincare routine. I use it on its own in large amounts of my face is chapped and so dry that its textured but mostly I just mix a pea-sized amount into my moisturizer in the morning and evening. its a great occlusive layer if you�re dehydrated too. Thick but absorbs pretty well so you aren�t a glossy oil slick after applying.   PLEASE RESTOCKI love pairing this on the nights I use my retinol because my skin gets so dry. This balm is silky smooth and SO hydrating. Stocking up on more for sureGood seasonal transition moisturizer perfect for transitioning from summer into fall. its not too thick or too thin just a nice texture. Could be slightly more moisturizing in my opinion but  liked it nonetheless.I love this moisturizer! I needed something in between water based gel creams and heavier creamy moisturizers. My skin is sometimes a little sensitive after using exfoliating toners and this does a good job of soothing my skin without breaking me out. The squeeze tube is also great for travel.
263067000000,Have been using this since 2018 and it is a holy grail!!!  Also it has really helped me control my mask acne - would recommend!been using it for several years and will continue to do so. It never dries or strips my skin even during the winter months. It doesn�t have any pungent tea tree scent and isn�t a harsh pure version which can irritate a lot of skin types. A nicely balanced yet gentle but highly-effective cleansing water — particularly great during the summer or at the gym as a quick skin refresher. Does an excellent job of keeping breakouts in check. I highly recommend it.This cleanse water can clean my face sunscreen very clean. What i love about this toner is that it doesn�t strip off my face moisture. It makes my face feel moist after wiping.Love this so much! It leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed perfect for a quick cleanse when you cant be bothered to get your face wet or tie your hair up. Will definitely be buying again ^)A must for my morning routine and after working out.
263602000000,Very nice productAlthough I have dry areas and oily areas on my skin this serum still gives me the balanced hydration I need throughout the day. My mom started even using this (oily skin 60 years old) and mentioned how much brighter her skin got! Most of all she loves the ingredients and the price compared to all of the other serums she used in the past (and believe me... she used ALOT!). I love love love this serum!This serum is hydrating and i feel like it really helped with my previous skin texture issues and Im always down for more antioxidants in my skincareFor me my priority in choosing a product to use is can this product hydrate my skin well? And this product does a great job of hydrating my skin - but in a way that it doesnt irritate and somewhat light. Recommend this product to people with dry skin. Great product for morning routine.This is the third bottle that I have bought. It keeps my face dehydrated. I love it.
263624000000,This mask is so calming for my skin after an active day in the sun or when my skin is inflamed from breakouts. I noticed that this masks makes my pimples smaller!I liked the way this made my skin feel. It was soft and plump but I found the serum to be kind of sticky. When I took it off and went to apply my night moisturizer it took longer than it usually does to absorb into my skin. My skin did have a nice healthy glow afterward though so I would say the stickiness was worth it.I loved this mask on my first try. I just received my second batch. What�s great is that there plenty product left in the package so when I removed my face mask after 15-20 min I�ll tear it half and soak those two halves with the leafy over product and apply on my hands since they�re overly dry from the weather and constant hand washing. And bonus! CLEAN ingredients!This mask was very hydrating and cooling. It definitely wasnt too heavy or sticky and soaked into my skin easily.Not sticky not goopy not aggressively scented in a way that makes you kind of nervous to leave on for 30 min. This is a great sheet mask and the cloth is super lovely and thin but strong. The description is right--the least drippy of the (many many) masks I own. Solid and will repurchase. Would purchase in packs too if they had them.
263625000000,I had very high expectations for this product. It was more expensive than any mask I had ever used and the reviews proclaimed it worked wonders. I have been searching for a product to get the deep gunk out of my T-zone for a long time and I thought that I had found it based in reviews. Very ugly packaging and it came fast but the product overall did nothing for me. I followed the instructions and after 15 minutes I took it off. There was no gunk Well Juliet I will lie with thee tonight. Let�s see for means. O mischief thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men. I do remember an apothecary (And hereabouts he dwells) which late I noted In tattered weeds with overwhelming brows Culling of simples. Meager were his looks. Sharp misery had worn him to the bones. And in his needy shop a tortoise hung An alligator stuffed and other skins Of ill-shaped fishes and about his shelves A beggarly account of empty boxes Green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses Were thinly scattered to make up a show. Noting this penury to myself I on the sheet and my pores looked inflamed and ”angry”. There was leftover residue from the sheet that can best be described as glue all over where the mask had been. Overall this probably clogged my pores more than it cleaned them. I am very disappointed and sad to have wasted my money on two of these.Love itI tried this semi-pricy black head remover with little expectations. I have always bought pore strips here in America that showed little to no promise in their value. I thought the whole time my pores were just too deep! THEN i bought this. HOLY. CRAP! I have never seen such HUGE gunk come out of my nose! i love this so much! I used one for my nose and then i cut up one to use on my cheeks and chin! HUGE disgusting chunks of stuff came out! Sorry if this is a gross review but I highly recommend! Although only use once a month if you have sensitive/combination/oily/acne skin like me lol. I did it once a week for 3 weeks in a row and broke out. But when I used it once a month it worked perfectly and took out a lot more gunk out of my face ). My pores are smaller and less noticeable! Thanks for this product!I had more success with this pore strip than Ive had with others I definitely liked it. As others mentioned I had a little trouble getting it all aligned right but Im sure with practice it will be easier. I noticed a definite decrease in visible blackheads after first use.It wasn�t sticking at all.
263643000000,It is good for a deep cleansing like any cleansing product.I would skip the Acwell 5.5 PH line if you have sensitive skin. It says its good for sensitive skin but my skin got super red and irritated upon switching to this product.Cleanses well but I�d advise to avoid if you are sensitive to fragrance. My sensitive skin tolerates this fine it doesn�t break me out but for some reason my eyes are sensitive to the slight fragrance in this product. I do feel like this dries my skin out as well so I wouldn�t repurchase.This is my go to cleanser year around its super gentle and mild. Smells a little soap-y but that doesn�t bother me.I was so excited to start my new skincare regimen and this water cleanser was recommended. What I like about it is there is no scent. The foam lathers up pretty quickly when rubbing it between my hands. Its so soft and gentle when applying it my face. However once I dry my face I noticed areas of my face felt itchy - around my nose cheeks forehead. My skin didnt turn red just made small areas of my face itchy and makes me want to scratch. The funny thing too is that really dont have sensitive skin. I can pretty much tolerate anything but there must to something in there that my skin doesnt like. Ill be switching to another cleanser for my face.
263644000000,I love this cleansing oil is my personal fave plus it lasts a long time. It doesnt burn and its really effectiveI use this to take off my maykup then use the green tea cleanser works perfectly for meI have eczema prone skin and this helps me without leaving my skin dry.Im obsessed with how silky and smooth this feels when using! I used a different oil cleanser before purchasing this one and found that it was hard to rub around and work into my skin but this oil cleanser is so smooth and easy to use that I only need one or two pumps to spread all over my face and get off all my makeup and sunscreen!I love this oil cleanser because I wasnt looking for anything TOO fancy. Some oil cleansers exfoliate or have other brightening properties but this one is just a good ol plain cleanser. It doesnt strip moisture from skin and is easy to use.
1299070000000,a sheet for everyday! I also love that theres an extra tool to take out a sheetmask. the smell is nice too ane it feels refreshing after this using one!While I entered the world of skincare I found out the hard way my skin was sensitive sensitive to fragrances fermentation almost anything ending in -ate. It was a trial and error and I found that sheet masks that were safe for my skin were few and far between. Until I snagged a few of my wife�s A�PIEU sheet masks (overtime because of course they�re daily and in a brilliant eco-friendly package). These are the ONLY masks have worked on my skin (so far). Yes the fit of the mask is very very off I find slitting the areas around my mouth and eyes makes for a more comfortable fit. its not as hydrating as other masks  tried but after sitting 20-mins I squeeze excess product on my face and pat in as if it were an essence. And voila I wake up looking like a new born baby that hasn�t been exposed to what is pollution. Only for the extra work done by me I give this product a 4. I hope there will be a product created in the future by this brand that fits faces universally and a smidge more hydrating without extra work.   *when storing flip your container upside down so the juices flow freely.I love the eco friendly idea of having multiple masks in one container and even the tweezers they provide to keep the masks sanitary. The hydration is great and product does the job. BUT the fit of the masks as other users have also reported is so off. I actually have to cut the mask in two (if Im not lazy) for a better fit. If it wasn�t for the weird fit I would give this 5 stars.I loved the concept of minimizing waste by not purchasing individual sheet masks but this mask did little to nothing for my combination skin.Hard to open the inner lid and the out lid hinges almost broken after only 5 uses
1299090000000,Love this ! I use it as a spot treatment for pimples as well.I bought this as a gift to my sister! It has helped so much with her mascne. Using this has helped my skin absorb the rest of my skin care products. I highly would recommend it acne prone skin.Helps keep my acne under control and it doesn�t dry out my skin. Im deducting one star due to the price point.whenever Im having a small breakout Ill even use it as a spot treatment and rinse it off in the morning and my blemish will be diminishedsuch a great mask to keep your skin clear and calm! whenever Im having a small breakout Ill even use it as a spot treatment and rinse it off in the morning and my blemish will be significantly reduced.
1303730000000,Loved using this mask -- the step 1 swab left my skin feeling tingly (Im super sensitive) but the jelly mask soothed that pretty quickly and left my skin feeling really fresh. Theres also plenty of the jelly serum left in the pouch afterward to use on chest/neck or save for the next day (I always stick it in an airtight bag so no bacteria gets in).I love this and use it when I need it I always have it on hand just in case I have a break out or need extra help sometimes it is on that time of the month this really seems to help out and I will always have it on stock at home.I initially bought this because I wanted to try this 2 part system and I was hesitant of it making any difference. The jelly texture was something I was not expecting but appreciated. It didnt feel like the swab did anything until I looked the next morning and my pores looked smaller and my nose looked cleared of whiteheads! It made a slight difference in my complexion and I really appreciated it. Look forward to repurchasingI definitely would buy this mask again. My skin had a nice glow and it reduced the appearance of my acne. I did use it at night because of the AHA and I would be careful if you have sensitive skin. There was a slight tingling on my face but that was soothed with the sheet mask after the swab.I tried this first after buying the variety pack and loved it. This is the first kut of the pack that tried and Im happy I did. It is so neat how you swab your face first then apply the mask. I was a bit skeptical thinking I would break out from the amount of jelly on the mask but I saw results the next day. I dont know if it was coincidence but my skin looked even and the redness from existing/previous acne had reduced like crazy. This is just one day!!! I WILL purchase again!!
1304660000000,This toner is silky smooth and lightweight. It absorbs easily usually taking about 3 minutes but more quickly if you pat-pat-pat it in. I noticed results in about 4 days. My skin texture smoothed out and redness around my temples diminished. I follow this toner with serums (i use different brands and multiple brands depending on what�s going on with my skin). I follow with Tatcha Water or Dewy Skin Cream or TIMY lotion Glow Recipe Retinol Avocado Eye Cream and the Tatcha mist.Im so glad I purchased this toner! I do notice a difference in the appearance of my pores. It goes well under makeup too!I bought it to try it out compared it to other toner with similar exfoliating toner. I dont write reviews until after Ive finished the whole bottle. It worked well as a toner but I didnt see any difference or feel any difference in my face. I usually use the COSRX one and will go back to that one.I have been using this toner for 3 weeks now and I can already see a difference in the way my pores look! It also leaves my skin soft without drying it. I use it twice a day in the morning and at night and my skin type is normal.When I used this product for the first time I noticed a huge difference the next morning! Pores define feels smoother and my skin feels softer. I highly recommend this product and I purchased it on a whim and Im so glad I did!! For reference I have combo aging (Im in my early 40s) with tiny pores around forehead and nose area. I think this would work fantastic on oily skin as well to help somewhat control excess oiliness on skin. Anyways I think its worth an invest to try this toner as it won�t break your bank. Also to note make sure you use a cotton pad to apply this toner. It does have a slight stickiness to it and I find it less thick on the skin if you follow the directions of using a cotton pad. Bc of the slight stickiness this would probably do very well under your makeup application for longevity.
1306790000000,i got this as a gift and it lasted me about three months. i used 3-4 pumps each time sometimes once or twice a day. Knowing how quickly I went through it I might have used it less so that it would last longer! This was only the second moisturizer Ive ever used after CeraVe. Loved how light it was just too expensive for me to buy again!My daughter introduced me to this product. It is the best face cream I have ever used. Im so glad that Soko Glam carries this product. Shopping was easy and delivery was efficientMy skin is very oily and I always hated moisturizing my face because it feels heavy on my skin until I found this moisturizer! Now I love to moisturize day and night! After using it for 3 months I ran out so I asked Soko Glam for something similar and cheeper. They recommend Etude House SoonJung Emulsion so ill be trying that next!Okay so I was skeptical at first. I saw the high price point but it was recommended to me during my skincare consultation so I took a leap of faith.  been using this product for a while now almost half a year (one bottle has lasted me this long) and I have noticed a difference in my skin. The areas of my face that used to look like an oil slick by the end of the day are now producing significantly less oil than before and my breakouts are less frequent than before. I have absolutely love this product I think its worth the price and I would most definitely repurchase.Okay. Not seen much difference but like the way it feels and smells on my skin
1308290000000,My skin is very sensitive and it reacts very well to this toner. Whenever I am tired of using other toners that do other things for the skin or have just done something that may irritate my skin (like exfoliating or if it is irritated in another way) I will reach for this. It hydrates my skin smells delightful and soothes it instantly. It is like a safe choice and a wonderful treat to the skin. I definitely will be repurchasing.This is hydrating it does not leave skin feeling dry. I am not a big fan of scents but this has a nice light rose scent. The cost is also very reasonable.This is by far my favorite rose water that I have ever used I transfer it to a bottle sprayer and not only is this product as refreshing as it smells I after I put on hyaluronic acid but I also spray my face and I find my skin is so much more plumper after its absorbed with the serum. Especially the day after absolutely 100% worth the price.One of the best toners I have used!Im always willing to pay more for good skincare so when I got a sample of this I thought it was a gimmick and just smelled nice. However it really moisturizes my skin as well as smelling natural! (Not synthetic smell... ) Im impressed and bought another one as a gift this winter. )
1312680000000,This product left my face feeling soft and moisturized through out the day. I ended up using this at night after applying the other products. No smell or irritation. Overall good product!This heals my skin so quickly after a pimple is popped.I thought I would really like this serum and I was excited to try it because of how cheap it was. First of all be warned that the bottle is really small and thats probably why its to cheap. This is on me because I should have read the information on how many fluid ounces it was. Second the dropper and this serum do not work together at all! The dropper does not pick up any of the serum because the serum is too thick. So in order to get the serum out of the bottle I had to turn the bottle upside down and shake it into my plan which caused to waste product what little product I already had I probably got 10-15 uses out of the little bottle definitely not enough for me to notice a difference with my skin. I would not recommend.I havent seen a huge difference by using this product. Its a bit sticky so I recommend applying a bit before bed (doesnt seem like a good AM product) very moisturizingI love how smooth this goes on. No real distinct smell noted which is ok. Leaves the skin feeling supple snd hydrated.
1313140000000,been a fan of snail bee products for years now and this serum is just as great as the rest. My skin loves it and looks great.Its not heavy or greasy it absorbs quickly and feels really niceSkin feels dewy after and slightly tacky which I love. It absorbs well and is very smooth when spreading on skin. Great for dry skin and no irritation.Goes on smoothly and feels very light. Sinks into my skin quickly. Definitely feels like my skin is more hydrated but not sure  noticed any other difference.I love this! Benton is becoming one of my favorite brands in skin care.  been using this for months and I e noticed a dramatic change in my skin. This leaves my skin plump burnished and bouncy. Overall its added to my skins health. I have combination skin and it has done wonders to add extra hydration and nutrition to the dry areas and is not too moisturizing for my oils areas. It is a thicker more viscous serum and a little goes a long way. It takes a little longer to absorb and can feel a little sticky. But leaving it for like 45 second followed by a good light weight moisturizer feels absolutely splendid!! Highly recommend!
1335520000000,So I purchased this because my rice exfoliant was almost done and I wanted to try something new. Im so glad I bought this. Leaves my skin feeling soft and the scrub isn�t rough. I was worried about that but its a gentle scrub. Would definitely purchase again.My new favorite face scrub! At first when I started massaging this onto my face I thought it was too harsh and I was nervous but as you keep massaging it dissolves and feels so nice and smooth! You have baby soft skin after one use (seriously)! I will keep buying for sure as this is now a must have in my routine. I definitely see why its a best seller )This sugar mask has all the right ingredients to give you that healthy glow. Nourishing and hydrating while giving you that gentle exfoliation.Love the glow I have after using this.really like this sugar exfoliant. I will be buying again when I run out. It smells nice its not irritating and it leaves my skin soft.
1451950000000,I love this mist! Im on my 2nd bottle now. It brightens up my skin and leaves my skin hydrated.Almost finished with the bottle. This is an effective essence mist. The bottle sprays a very fine mist. Im not sure if it made a huge difference in terms of brightening my complexion but the is still very soothing and did not irritate my skin at all. It is especially soothing when used after refrigeration. This product made me purchase the toner from the same line which I love!Loved.Another product I love so much! It refreshes your skin through out the day. It both immediately hydrates your face and locks in moisture long term. This product is a must!!!!!!I was looking for a product that would help me minimize red marks after acne. This product feels great and gives a soothing feeling I havent been using it for a long time so I cannot tell if it would reduce my marks a lot but at least I can say Im currently really happy with the product and it was a great addition to my routine
1451960000000,I didn�t expect this to work quite as well as it did. I had use this brands� egg lore cleanser and it worked wonders after a while but I stopped because I got lazy and I saw this and it helped almost as much!Bought this in hopes that it would help reduce the visible pores on my face mostly on the tip of my nose. It does make the skin feel soft and smooth afterwards but I didnt notice any visible reduction in pore size or visibility. The mask also has a clay-like consistency once it dries and its rather cakey and difficult to remove. Its fine as a face mask but dont count on pore size reduction. Wouldnt buy again.Hi Lara!  The size of pores cannot be reduced as their size is determined by genes and hormones. However products such as this mask help minimize the appearance of pores through thoroughly cleansing and removing blackheads and impurities.  I hope this helps!I liked how my skin felt but it wasnt as good at cleansing my pores as I had hoped. Since I have oily skin I expected it to really clean my pores but the feeling of being clean and moisturised was not thereDefinitely cleans out my pores (especially on my nose) and leaves them way more clean than pore strips typically do. My boyfriend and I both approve-- and it doesnt dry out our skin (we both have dry/sensitive skin)!
1456380000000,The serum of this mask is SO good! Absorbs well left my skin so glowy and I noticed a brighter complexion taking it off. Love it!I was so happy to find this as my dry skin really reacted well to SB in the past. This is incredibly moisturizing no smell no orange color just a great face mask. Im so glad SB is getting into different applications now. I cant wait to repurchase this!.I LOVE the serum this mask is drenched with! With plenty of serum leftover smear it all over your body. My only issue and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it does not fit me well the eye holes are huge and that is where I want coverage the most. So I soak 2 cotton round with the extra serum and place them under my eyes. Easy fix but an extra step and the rounds tend to fall off. But worth it to me for that yummy seabuckthorn.I ended up really liking this mask. It made my skin much brighter. I�ll probably buy this again.Didnt notice an immediate brightening effect but only used the mask one time. The mask worked well with my other products though and contained many of the same ingredients though in a more natural formulation so as to not cause any issues. I love that while it contains ingredients to help with my hyperpigmented scars it also has ingredients to calm redness and irritation as well. I would purchase this again.
1706890000000,I use these masks occasionally when my skin is acting up.  used Benton masks in the past and these did not disappoint. My skin appeared less inflamed after my first use so I definitely recommend. I initially purchased 5 sheets and will continue to buy more once Im out.I was struggling from redness due to the weather + acne and this mask really helped me to soothe my skinGreat! Great!I don�t have good luck when it comes to sheet masks and this further proves it. It was easy to put on but left my skin dry and sticky even after massaging in the remaining serum/essence.Hi Jeff  Thank you for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error and Im sorry to hear that this product didnt wrk out for you! Please know that we are here to provide alternative recommendations more suitable to your preferences )
1706910000000,I have STRUGGLED to find a suitable essence especially because my skin can become overwhelmed easily with product. This balances my complexion smooths and even my texture and my skin just drinks it in. Yes it is pricey but you literally do not need more than one pump for your entire face and neck. The smell sort of smells like the perfume of an older woman but it doesn�t stick around or harass you throughout the day- usually dissipates in a minute. If you�ve been struggling with finding a good essence that really enhances the effects of your routine- maybe give this a try!its so good. I feel my skin become more smooth and better.I love this essence water! It really moisturizes your skin so well. its not sticky at all it just makes your skin feel so smooth and refreshed!! I will definitely be purchasing another once Im half way through.It feels great on the skin very hydrating.Very hydrating when applied after a toner worth the price. Also the fragrance smells very good.
1706920000000,It leaves my sling very soft and hydrate itFor how this winter has been this is saving my skin during the day. I use my normal daily moisturizer & layer this over top. It does soak in but keeps my skin supple throughout the day.makes skin plump and dewy.Glides on super smooth and holds all the moisture close to my skin. Excellent for sensitized skin. Helps calm it down.I have been using this for a month now and I totally notice the balance in my skin tone. I also instantly noticed the hydration that was replenished in my skin without making My face feel sticky. This product is amazing! Will keep buying this!!
1888570000000,Been using this product for about 3 months and its has dried out my chin and around my mouth with red itchy bumps and because of the high ph level just didn�t work for me. Just drying and irritating and I have super red and sensitive skin that�s oily but don�t get me wrong this might work for someone elesI love how the hyaluronic feels on my skin. It does a really good job cleansing my face.Im a big fan of this cleanser. You do not need a lot to get a good lather all over your face. Just be cautious about this cleanser in the eye area because it can cause minimal discomfort nothing burning or intense. I have a light touch when washing my eye area with this. I make sure that all or a majority of my eye makeup is removed from the first cleanse. Otherwise I really enjoy this cleanser.Best face wash for any skin type!This cleanser drys my skin and it smells terrible. So much so I tossed it after the 3rd use. Will not be purchasing ever.
1888580000000,Moisturizing but I think the construction of the mask could be better there are parts of my face that could be more covered.I initially got these masks because you get 10 for $24 and are chock full of hyaluronic acid. But OMG not only do you get a good bang for your buck they are SO SOOTHING! They feel amazing on dry sensitive skin. Highly recommend!!!!I have very dry skin with aczima  this mask is very hydrating and gentle it fills my face with moisture.Wonderful mask! Hydrating and soothing. I wish Soko Glam carried the Sur Medic Propolis Sheet Mask also.This face mask fits nicely. I would t say my skin felt amazing afterwards though.  used better hydrating ones from the pharmacy that cost $5 each. But I do like how nicely this one hugs my face.
1942740000000,I have tried this product multiple times and I keep getting breakouts from it. I am now trying to just use it on my neck. Im surprised because my skin is normal/dry and can normally take a heavy cream just fine. Something in this product breaks me out (This may just be a facial moisturizer but it makes me feel so luxurious. Its so creamy and exactly what you would want a moisturizer to be. It absorbs fantastically so you can wear it both morning and night but it is moisturizing enough to be a night cream. It also smells nice and what fragrance is there is super light. Also its packaging is super nice they fill it very well and you only need a tiny amount to cover your entire face. 1 jar of it has lasted an entire year and I am not even ready to move on to the next one I ordered a while ago when I realized how much I loved it. Its the only thing in my current skin care routine that I absolutely will NOT change when I empty things (I am okay with swapping out other products until I find a holy grail product which this cream is for me). I love love love it!Subtly fragranced thick and creamy without being comedic or sticky. I have been using this day and night (winter use). Absorbs well. I love this cream!Yes the dynasty cream packaging is beautiful to look at but it also works to enhance skin glow and texture. Used with the cleansing balm my face feels soft and velvety. I am always going for a glow and this product does that for me. Oh and did I say the packaging is gorgeous?It gave my skin a very nice glow it was extremely moisturizing but not too heavy. I can see how it may not work well for oily skin especially during summer. However it works very well for normal to dry skin especially during cooler months.
1946050000000,quality sheet maskI loved this mask! It really brightened my skin left it soft and smelled really nice (but not overpowering or too perfume-y).I live in the northern US... in the winter my skin is so dry! I have to be careful because Im prone to breakouts and clogged pores. This mask was awesome! Hydrated my dry skin without clogging. Great product!Love this mask it left my skin feeling hydrated and it looked more even. I recommend using these items before you apply makeupThis mask was kinda hard to handle the instructions werent exactly right as there were protective gauze on both sides that needed to be taken off. It was a little hard to get on but stayed on well one I got it on. I liked the jelly like soft texture of the mask itself.  It wasnt super pleasant to have on and was kinda stingy. My face wasnt super red after but was a little pink. After it took a while to dry so definitely a night time. It left my skin with the glassy look. I got it for lightening acne hyper pigmentation spots. I assume Id have to use it more often to get results.My skin is soft though!
1946060000000,every time i make a purchase on sokoglam i always make sure to pick up some of these amino mask the best especially when its so cold and dry outside👍Extremely hydrating and always look amazing the next daythis left my skin feeling so soothed and plump! will order againThe most hydrating mask Ive tried with lots of extra serum to pat in afterward! Its also gentle on my acne-prone skin and has never caused a breakout. I keep a few in my fridge at all times!
1948540000000,Its a great oil cleanser that doesnt dry out my already dry skin the only reason it doesnt get all 5 stars is because it takes some work to get my waterproof mascara off when there are other oil cleansers out there that do the work better and with less rubbing. It has a soothing lavender scent which is very pleasing and would make a great cleanser for someone who doesnt wear waterproof mascara.I love this cleanser for the convenience of 2-in1 and the moisture. It does have fragrance but I like it and it doesnt irritate my skin. Sadly my bottle is gone and its been out of stock for months. I havent found anything I like as well as this product.I started using this cleansing oil when I was on Isotretinoin only because the name was Dryness Off and my face was excruciatingly dry. I LOVED it and it was the only cleanser that didnt burn but cleaned my face beautifully. I continue to use it twice a day as part of my double cleansing routine now that Im off Isotretinoin and I still love it and the way it cleans and feels.Ive always used DHC as my go-to and this will be my new favorite. I love the light lavender scent!I really liked this product at first as it smelled great and was hydrating. However not long after using it I noticed that my eyes became dry and sensitive. I thought it was environmental allergies until I used this product to break down my makeup and my eyes became very irritated and I had to wash out with water. I stopped using it and realized the issue was this product. I think it would be good for your skin but those with sensitives I would be cautious. Soko Glam has great customer service though and an awesome return policy.
1948570000000,I love these masks! They smell delightful - but not fake - and theyre so saturated in serum that I can save the package and use the leftovers on a day I dont use a mask. My skin has been freaking out lately and these calm it down.I love using these masks after doing an enzyme peel. They�re refreshing bud also very gentle and hydrating!These masks are on the more expensive end but well worth it. Whenever my skin is dry (which is very often in the winter) I would pop one on and my skin will literally GLOW after using it. Very hydrating and lots of serum left in the packet great for additional application ! I love that some money will go toward the cat sheltersI feels so good on my face and the serum is so soft and luxurious. I will definitely order again.I shared this mask with a friend who said she doesnt like sheet masks. She gushed over it and asked me where I bought them the next day. They are the perfect mask for hormonally stressed out skin and just giving your skin a break. The sheet mask is high quality and really sticks to your face too )
1948690000000,Seriously man where has this been all my life ??? My combination skin loves it! It gives u that hydration u need for ur skin and also give that nice blurred semi matte skin look . So refreshing and sinks into the skin like a dream !!! After so many Korean SPF fails this is one of the sunscreens that passed the test so it is completely safe to use! People need to make it more hype for real ! 👏👏👏FINALLLYYYYYYYYYY a sunscreen that Black people can use without that gross film!!! This one right here is SO nice on your skin and FULLY rubs in. I love the smell its so lightweight and doesn�t make you oily. This is the GOAT I haven�t found one better yet. THANK YOU FARMER!!!!!!My skin is on the sensitive side and I have a combination skin. This sunscreen makes my skin to feel very soft after applying and doesnt make my skin feeling oily though out the day. I recommend to try it!I struggled to find a sunscreen that did not leave a white cast did not make my skin oily while also not drying it out. Tinted sunscreens were not for me.   I am soooo glad I found this product. Its amazing and literally does everything they say it does. 10/10 would recommend!I haven�t used my product yet but I thought it would helpful for everyday in South Carolina and I am very pleased with customer service
1978240000000,This is an excellent sheet mask. Its super hydrating and makes my skin look brighter and more bouncy. Im new to the Dr. Althea brand and so far I really love it.Im impressed with these sheet masks. They are soothing and have a cooling effect and all the product soaks into your skin without leaving too much to pat in when you take it off. Ive only tried two of them so far and I havent had any negative reaction to them. The smell is fresh but not overpowering. I would buy these again.This has quickly become my favorite mask. I love the texture of the sheet itself and the essence leaves my skin feeling soft and pampered.Leaves my face soft and dewy. I like using these after an active day in the sun. Very calming for my skin and the next day still dewy too!If they werent so expensive I would use one everyday . Left my skin tingly in a good way. Felt very nice and calming left a glow and nice hydration. I would be buy again!
1978250000000,this is my ultimate favorite mask!!! the cotton used is extremely soft and its a game changer! i even prefer this mask to other more expensive ones. i bought another 2 packs!!Im loving these sheet masks! The mask “material” is so soft and the essence felt great on my skin. I will definitely be buying more from this brand!This mask felt so soothing and nourishing. I loved the milky texture of the essence and it left my skin looking and feeling soft with a nice even complexion.How often do you hear about velvet sheet masks? The texture of the mask itself is very plush though its not velvet in the way you might think about velvet fabric. The ampoule itself is very milky and doesn�t dry down sticky. There�s enough left in the package for another use or two afterwards too. Yum!Super moisturizing and will be a new regular addition to my routine
1981330000000,Feels so good. Doesn�t dry or overly oil my face. Easy to apply and doesn�t dry out in container.I have very sensitive acne prone combination skin and this stuff has been fantastic! its really gentle yet powerful enough to take off all of my makeup and sunscreen.  tried other oil cleansers including just straight up jojoba oil and this is the only one to 1) cleanse 2) moisturize 3) not break me out 4) and not leave a residue after water cleansing. After I use the cleansing oil pads I massage the oil on my face then water cleanse with the coconut water cleanser also from solved and its been great! So this helps moisturize my dry zones without making my oily zones oilier AND doesn�t break me out... winner!Sooooo good!!!LovedThese cleaning pads are amazing they smell soo good and leave your skin feeling soft and not irritated at all. Works even better when paired with foaming face wash.
2023960000000,I originally got this for my newly aging skin to get a head start on taming back fine lines/signs of aging. Ive been using this for a few months & this ampoule has been a game changer with my hormonal acne. The niacinamide being in such a high dose has worked wonders at taming the amount of breakouts and time it takes them to heal! The moisturizing ingredients have certainty delivered as well leaving my skin supple and rejuvenated.  These ingredients work like nothing Ive experienced before.  Not at all the results I expected but very pleased and will be repurchasing.   Oh! & If the silicone reviews make you just as weary as I was dont let them. Ive surprisingly/obviously had no issue with buildup or clogged pores by using a double cleansing method in the morning and at night.I absolutely love this White Truffle Intensive Ampoul. It reminds me of another hign end serum that is white from Estee Lauder but what keeps me coming back for this product is its clean! The scent is light it absorbs nicely and my skin is super soft. Im 60 yrs old with minimal lines and no deep wrinkles. I give that credit to the K-Beautt skin care Ive been using. The price of this serum is reasonable too. A little goes a long long way. Im about out of my 1st bottle which lasted me a long time but because of the fact theres no preservatives Im leary of keeping products too long if I havent used all the serum. The scent is still pleasant from my bottle so Im assuming its still good and the dropper insures that not much air gets into the bottle when its open. If you havent tried this White Truffle ampoul you need to try it. Great for dry skin and doesnt leave an oily residue so Im also confident oily complexions can benefit from this serum.It sinks right into my skin!!!So far so good! I absolutely love how this ampoule leaves my skin! It is silky and the formula makes my skin glow from within!  I love the milky texture as well and my skin soaks it up! I started using sokoglam stuff for my entire skin care routine and I am obsessed you offer fantastic rewards and for my birthday gift I received one of my wishlist items!very mousterizing it feels very luxerious
2024030000000,Ive used this cleanser for over a month now and it has helped reduce the number of breakouts I get. Theres still some of it left after that amount of time since I use one pump in the morning and one pump for nighttime. After washing it off my face doesnt feel tight or abnormally dry at all. I used this alongside Olay Complete Moisturizing Lotion SPF 15 for daytime and Benton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel at night and my skin has been doing well ever since. Even though I dont see it being a cleanser that can work by itself (as in no need for oil cleansing I dont have an oil cleanser yet but I will get one soon) this does what I want as a water-based cleanser and will repurchase. I dont have an oil cleanser yet.It works so well with the coconut oil cleansing pads from solved. The foam is so nice and fluffy! it cleanses really well without leaving my skin feeling stripped.Emptied! Super soft luxurious fluffy foam that lasts. Absolutely zero irritation even when used directly in eyes. Perfect for ultra sensitive skin. Basically scent-free. Recommend for those who need something extra gentle. Could be more affordable but thats my only critique!Feels very luxurious on skin and leaves skin feeling soft after useI always get nervous when something says coconut because of coconut oil but this coconut water cleanser makes my skin feel clean and hydrated. 2 pumps is more than enough. Will be repurchasing.
2024050000000,been using this product for a while now and is my fave to date. its so soothing after a double cleanse.I like the smell and how the toner clean my face very nice.This toner was not bad not good just so-so. Too much money for what you get.I love this toner! I was looking for something to temporarily replace my Neogen Calendula cleansing water since its always out of stock and this is perfect. This toner smells strongly of flowers but isnt overpowering or caustic. And its gentle on my sensitive skin which typically gets irritated by practically everything.I have a combination skin type I get oily on my forehead and temples (and occasional on my chin).  been using this product for less than a month. At first I would use the product all over my face but after a few days of usage I noticed that it was over drying the spots on my face that are normal/less oily and like a previous reviewer said when layering products on top it causes a really bad burning and tingly feeling on the parts of my face that are overly dried. Mostly around my mouth...like where a mustache would grow (in that area). The three star is because it works really well when it comes to reducing the oil on my forehead. I guess its because the toner is meant for oily skin and putting it where my skin is not as oily has negative effects.
2024650000000,I absolutely love this it makes my skin so unbelievably soft and I use it on Sundays and Thursdays. I highly recommendI initially received this peel gel as a sample and have since ordered it twice. The price point is good and I find it a very effective product not to mention satisfying to use. I alternate between this and the Neogen Lemon Peel pads. I am prone to hormonal acne along my jawline and this product seemed to really help clear that up when used with other treatments.   Note that if used correctly it is a relatively gentle exfoliant - but it is possible to overdo it so be kind to your face and dont scrub too much!It works well on my forehead and around the nose but as soon as it touches my cheeks my rosacea flares up for hours... Maybe be careful if you also have sensitive skin.I have dry sensitive and acne prone skin. I have to exfoliate often to keep acne at bay but also keep a light touch. This exfoliant is nice feeling works beautifully (I love using it on my Vit C serum nights) and doesnt smell strongly of anything. I am a repeat buyer!good
2032450000000,Since Ive started using this product I no longer need a physical exfoliator unless I want ti use one. My dry skin flakes have pretty much disappeared and my skin looks new. I cant imagine not using this. It honestly transformed my skincare routine!This a gentle exfoliating essence. However the texture was too thich and more like a serum. I was expecting more of a fluid like texture and was disappointed. Did not continue using.good product but if used too much it may irritate skinMy favorite chemical exfoliant. I love waking up to smooth and glowing skin the mornings after I use this product (not more than a few times a week!). Its not too irritating has a high concentration of AHA and is an excellent value. Just start slowly.I have tried many chemical exfoliants in the past but none measure up to this one. It just tingle when you put it on your skin which I personally like. I haven�t been having issues with my dry skin since I have started using it 2-3 times per week.
2070550000000,Just received this & trying it for the first time. So far I am liking it.I absolutely love this cleanser! its super light and doesn�t make my face feel saturated (I have oily skin). It smells pleasant and not strong. One of my favorite things about the cleanser is you don�t need much at all to use! It will last a while but I would definitely recommend to anyone! I use it along side the cleansing balm and dear hydration toner and moisturizer.I literally only need half a pea size of this stuff and it foams very well to clean my entire face and neck. Even after rinsing off and drying it doesnt leave my skin try and tight. Smell is pleasant and not too strong either.I just LOVE the Clean It Zero Foam Cleanser! it hydrates my skin and gets it totally clean. Ive been using it with a muslin cloth lately and the results are amazing. I love the fragrance -- its almost a candy smell. Its great to keep in the shower.Creamy and light not stripping. Doesnt irritate my story sensitive skin either.
2074420000000,Probably one of my favourite moisturizers so nice and light and smooth. Makes me feel so hydrated 100% will buy againI bought this this for my mom (already on her second bottle). She said she loves this product it is very hydrating and she can tell her face feels lifted/tighter and very soft.   I introduced the Korean skincare to my mom about a year ago and she has been so obsessed. She does not want to use any other kind but the K-beauty. I Cant blame her.   Skin type and age Is based my momI was hoping for more of a cream but this is a gel. oily skin this might be perfect but I didnt really feel it did much for me & I needed to reapply because it left my skin feeling dry even though we lived in humid Georgia. didnt notice much for my crows feet either. Going to spend a few bucks more to try the Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream.I use this as my nighttime moisturizer. I can say I love the texture and how it goes on. It is super smooth. I have only been using it for about a month so I Cant say I have seen any improvement in skin tightening which is what I want at 47! But I typically give new items 6 months unless I really don�t like it. I will continue to use this product.The product photo looked more like a cream to me (and its even in the name!) but this is a gel-type moisturizer. I have dry skin and usually need a thick cream at night so this didnt quite work for me. I applied a layer and it got absorbed quickly but my skin felt taut so I applied another layer. I repeated this 2 more times and gave up. I found that using a layer of this and putting on Egyptian Magic on top works well. Using the oily Egyptian Magic alone doesnt feel moisturizing to me so Im thinking maybe the Collagen Lifting Cream has high water content but not much oil. Hence Im guessing this would work better for someone with an oily skin.
2074450000000,Another product I have been wanting to try! Glad I did! This definitely does its job! It cleans my face perfectly and makes skin feeling nice! its not harsh nor does it have any strong smell! This is the first product I use am and pm and then I follow up with the cleaning oil! What a great combination!This is a great product especially for sensitive skin. I have very dry & sensitive skin HOWEVER after the first two weeks I began to notice that my pores werent as clean and my face was extremely oily even after I washed my face with a water-based cleanser. Overall its one of the better cleansing balms I have used yet but it leaves my face feeling oily rather than clean.Hi Shallom   We are sorry to hear that the product didnt work out for you. Please reach out to hellosokoglam.com and we will be happy to get you all sorted. Have a good day!This pore cleansing balm didnt dry out my skin. This oil cleanser was better than any other that I have used.This smells amazing and melts into your skin like a dream. I use it in the shower and my face feels amazing afterwards.
2092490000000,I bought this after using a Nacific sheet mask and really enjoying the fresh herbal scent and results. This eye cream is nice for PM use (too sticky/too long to absorb for my daytime routine) but at my age I need a thicker bouncier firming eye cream for night that targets wrinkles. So this won�t be a repurchase for me but for a younger person looking for a solid PM eye cream as a preventative and moisturizing measure this could be a great choice.I actually got this product in my monthly Ipsy bag. I love it! I really wanted a product that would brighten my eye area and this has worked a lot better than the former cream I was using. The fact that it is clean and cruelty-free makes it a winner in my book!I got this from ipsy i would definitely repurchase this. Its very moisturizing a little heavy but its perfect for dry skin and night time useI got this product in my first Ipsy bag. Its the best eye cream Ive ever used--and Ive used many. This beats several much more expensive brands (including clinique biossance etc.). I have heavy eyelids that are very puffy in the morning and are starting to show fine lines. I also have extremely sensitive skin. This product is hydrating comfortable effective and does not irritate my eyes or skin AT ALL. Fantastic. The tube is huge but I will probably repurchase when it runs out (next year? lol).I was tempted to return this eye cream because it gave me whiteheads in my eye area durning my first 2 weeks of use. I battle with acne but this is something I had never experienced.   The last straw was when I got a clogged pore on my lower lash line. It hurt so bad! Hence I deducted a star.   I was going to return this item but with COVID-19 it didnt seem worth it. To be fair I do have sensitive oily acne prone skin.   Ive continued to use the eye cream as Im at my parents house and this is the only one I have. Im passed the breakout point and overall its a good moisturizer. The retinol/vitamin A is working and I have seen my fine lines improve.
2092510000000,It works well but when applying it feels like it stays on the surface and doesn�t absorb.Received this product as a sample I love it immediately. It makes my other beauty products work more efficiently.In just a couple short weeks of using this product Im already seeing improvements in my skin. Definitely more hydrated and supple.I love this product I love how it layers under my serums and moisturizerbeen using this for a couple of weeks and so far I like it. I like the feeling of it and it has zero fragrance.
2103910000000,I was hasn�t it to get this at first because I read a lot of the reviews saying it wouldn�t apply but if you read carefully you are not supposed to shake the bottle. The pink powder and liquid are supposed to be separated. Then what you do is you Take a Q-tip to the bottom and take it out and you will see it stays on. Then just dab it on your blemishes.Love this product. I usually use the Mario Badescu product. I tried this one as I do most of my beauty shopping with Soko Glam. The text consulting is super helpful so this was a recommendation from the team based on what I have used in the past that works.Works well to dry out blemishes and whiteheads and doesnt irritate my sensitive skin or leave red burns around the pimple site afterwards an issue Ive had MANY times in the past with acne spot treatments. I think this works as well as (or even better than) most pimple patches on the market.My 16 year old son loves this. It helps reduce redness and swelling around his larger pimples and with smaller blemishes they go away much faster. This also helps keep him from squeezing and touching his face so much. Just have to remember to wash it off well before leaving the house or it will look like you have calamine lotion dotted all over your face!I bought this for my 15 year old daughter. She had a patch of very irritated large pimples near her hairline. After using this product for less than a week the pimples are completely dried up and flat. It does leave a little residue that is difficult to wash off but its worth it since it definitely cleared up her skin. Would definitely recommend.
2140920000000,I got a sample of this essence in one of my SokoGlam orders. I almost threw it away but ended up bringing it on a trip (pre-COVID) and I am SO glad I tried it! That night I replaced my Neogen Micro Ferment Essence with this Danahan Essence and the next morning I touched my skin while washing my face and could not believe how velvety it felt. It was INCREDIBLE. Ive been fortunate enough to never have had to deal with acne but I didnt realize that this degree of softness was even achievable. I looked up the price though and decided not to purchase since it was pretty pricey. Fast forward a couple years and my skin barrier has become a bit compromised in the last few months because Ive overdone it on some actives. Paulas Choice Vitamin C Booster made my skin even more velvety but after awhile I developed some texture and irritation. I tried some barrier restoring and calming products only to come to the sad conclusion that niacinamide irritates my skin. I remembered this essence and decided to purchase it. Im happy to report that it is non-irritating has soothed my irritation (Im a month into Tretinoin) and still makes my skin super soft. There is a perfume-y scent but thats never been an issue for me and I think it smells good.I love this essence. If you love herbal scents then this is perfect. I always feel very relaxed when applying this. The texture is very smooth and thicker than expected. I feel moisturized after applying and my skin feels very soft/ smooth. I didnt break out from this product at all and its one item in my skincare routine that I look forward to using.I love the smell of this essence! Tbh it has more of a serum consistency... Im not sure if it does anything other than hydrate my face but I love how smooth it feels on the skin and it also doesnt leave a sticky residue.This essence is hydrating and works well with my ordinary activesI like this essence it did not sting my skin this may sound funny one night I felt something smooth on my face and then I realized it was my skin! Im not kidding thumbs up.
2144370000000,I previously was using an oil with vitamin c and bought this to replace it. I love that it just absorbs into my skin.I love this serum! I have combination skin so some vitamin C serums may aggravate my skin. I was delighted to feel nothing but relief when this went on my skin. I use both day and night and my skin looks brighter by the day. The formula they made was amazing and Im glad I got my hands on this one! So should you!A vitamin c serum I keep going back to. Not heavy on fragrance nourishes and I actually see a difference when I use this product.I have sensitive and dry skin so I was quite reluctant to try another vitamin C product. However after about a month of using this serum I noticed that my hyperpigmentation went away! No irritation or breakouts and it brightens my skin. Definitely recommend.I have sensitive and combo skin. I tried the Triple C lightning before and it was a little too strong so I was wary of trying this. But after a month of consistently using it I noticed many of my dark spots have faded and my face overall looks brighter! I like it so far!
2161750000000,Really good at clearing spots without overly drying and causing my skin to flake.Dries my pimples without drying my skin. It goes on clear I use this at night on target areas.Best acne treatment gel I have ever used. I have tried basically all of them and none of them has ever been like this product. It doesnt dry out my pimple or make it more red and irritated like other acne treatments. I love the gel like consistency. Within a day of using this my pimple is less red and noticeable and within a few days it is practically gone without leaving a mark. Really comes in handy when I get those annoying hormonal breakouts. I will definitely buy again.The consistency of the product is cool and soothing. Not claiming overnight miracle results but definitely helped heal and relieve breakouts over a couple of days (longer for angrier bumps). Not at all drying in my experience.I saw results either the next day or couple days after. I dont have acne and rarely get blemishes or problem areas so take my review with a grain of salt. But I had a baby not too long ago so my skin has changed and have been getting some bumps here and there and mild breakout areas (tiny bumps) and this stuff clears it--either clears it all the way or at least calms it down! love this stuff! and a little goes a long way!
2161760000000,???? literally so good. i avoided all USA sunscreens due to the insane chemicals in them and their quality. this right here is a holy grail tho i mean the consistency? perfect. not thick n greasy and dragging on your skin like every spf i try. it makes my skin so soft n glowy after my routine No white cast and wears beautifully under make up. I bought 2 since it is a small bottle but I don�t regret it one bit. Don�t think i�ll be switching anytime soon!!!This sunscreen is the holy grail of all sunscreens. No white cast at any depth of skin and its velvety smooth for multiple reapplications even if you�re sweaty. The only downside is how small amount comes in the package. After the first day it was half empty although I only used it on my face.This sunscreen feels good and goes on well over lotion. Also doesnt feel like it has a lot of white cast. Definitely recommend!I discovered this product recently and it has become a new staple in my skincare routine. i mostly use with no to little makeup. Sometimes I use concealer in a few spots on top of the sunscreen. Product leaves NO white cast and is light and breathe-able. I read that it is not waterproof but I have had no issues with any of it bleeding into my eyes while exercising & sweating. This product has become a new favorite and I highly recommend it!This is the first sunscreen  been loyal to in quite awhile. It has a great lightweight but emollient texture. I can usually skip a morning moisturizer when using this sunscreen. No white cast and only a mild sunscreen scent which I don�t mind at all.
2162380000000,This isn�t my favorite foam cleanser but its nice. If you�re worried about ingredients then this is a great option. its clean and vegan (why I got it). Smells very slightly minty and feels like a dry foam which is hard to explain but it does the job.Tried this a few times but just terrible for me. Firstly it is very hard to wash away. The first time I made the mistake of using 2 pumps and it took far too much time water and rubbing to get to the point where I could not feel it on my skin. Then once it was all off my face was as dry as the desert. Maybe this would work for someone who has super oily skin but definitely not for me.This keeps its foam I think it might be a little drying. But it also winter so Im super dry anyway. But it is gentle no real smell.Hi purchased this after the session with consultant. I thought this would help my sensitive skin. But it made more worse. My skin became extremely dry and flaky and i can see wrinkles in my forehead. Usually I see that when it is super dry. Hopefully I will be able to find better one.I have never used a face wash where my skin felt instantly better after use. its light in texture and scent but a little bit goes a long way. For a foam cleanser I was impressed by how well it spreads without fizzing out right away. Immediately after use my pores feel tight and my skin feels so clean and smooth. Will be purchasing again and again
2162420000000,At first I wasn�t sold on the thickness of the cream but after I started using topicals for my acne this was the only cream that felt soothing for dry and tight skin. It especially feels good after sun exposure or dry winter skin. This will be my 3rd time purchasing!It makes my face to feel very hydrated and very soft! HIGHLY RECOMMENDI havent used this enough yet but my first thoughts are that I love moisturizers that come in tubes because it feels more hygienic. I have dry skin and I wanted a moisturizer for the warmer weather. Ive heard this is better suited for the winter months but my skin is so dry that it drinks this right up. With a serum underneath I think this will make your skin look plump and dewy!I was very excited to ise this cream until I broke out in such an awful way. The firet time I used it I broke out so I decided to stop because I thought that maybe I used it with another product it doesnt go with but no. Used it for a 2nd time and woke up with my fave feeling like a bad road.Hi Mo   I am so sorry to hear that about your reaction! Please reach out to hellosokoglam.com and we will be happy to get you all sorted. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Have a good day!
2171560000000,I love how my face feels and looks after using these. All of the Mediheal masks are amazing and I highly recommend.Love them! Use them once a week!love this brand some of my favorite sheet masks.very brightening and leaves your skin glowingThis definitely does what it says it will do. I usually avoid products with charcoal as it can be a little to drying for my skin but this was not drying at all. My skin felt and looked clear bright and hydrated afterwards. Super happy with this one!
3860430000000,Feels good smells good.  only been using it about 2 weeks but I like it so far.I really like this eye cream. I have noticed my dark circles lessen in the week and a half  been using this.  had no issues applying makeup on top of this product either. It will take more time to see how this handles wrinkles but I have high hopesMy first ever order came with a sample of this eye cream and it lead me to purchasing it. Dark circles were minimized and made my face looked more awake and refreshed. Very light and easy cream.This cream isn�t too thick and has a nice consistency. It has helped my dark circles in just a week!I originally got this in the sample size and used it to the last drop. So I ordered the full size because it makes the skin around my eyes feel great! Recommend )
3860440000000,Finish the whole bottle. It was good calming skin and very hydratingThis is my go to toner when I need a little extra moisture. It has a slightly heavier (less watery) consistency than other toners but it works well to provide that extra layer of moisture to my dry skin.I love that this toner is a little thicker. I apply this with my hands by patting my face with me hands. It makes me face feel clean and fresh .I love this toner so much! I have sensitive dry acne-prone skin and this has kept ny face hydrated while slowly helping with my acne scars. It has a nice smell which eventually goes away but feels extremely luxurious. its not watery at all and my skin absorbs it beautiful.  I just purchased my second bottle. It came in a different presentation with different cap and the bottle had a new font which did concern me a little bit however I trust SKG and its probably just a new presentation from the brand.A subtle yet effective base for my facial skin routine.
3860450000000,I bought this on a whim to try out and needless to say Im already almost half way through my second bottle! I could pair a few layers of this with a few layers of my Acwell Licorice Toner throw on some moisturizer sunscreen and go on about my day if I wanted! Its so light weight it just seeps into the skin while hydrating and giving the most beautiful glowIve been looking for an SKII dupe for the longest time because that thing be expensive af but gives the most beautiful glow. No other first essence Ive tried has replicated the results of SKII for me until I tried this.  This thing is great! It basically feels the same as SKII without the scent. And it gave the healthiest looking glow too. Highly recommended!This water essence goes on effortlessly and feels nourishing and soothing. 4 stars because it sometimes feels slightly astringent after application which I expect more from a toner than an essence. I suspect this may be a good product for people who want a single product to act as toner and essence or people with oilier skin than mine. Well worth the money but I will probably replace with Neogen.I have very sensitive skin and get super oil and super dry in some spots this evens out my tone perfectly. It very hydrating where I need it to be but not too heavy where Im oily.I never write reviews-but this product is amazing. It cleared my tinea versicolor more effectively than my doctors prescribed medicine.
3924690000000,I love that it is spray and the smell is so good.I received this as a gift with purchase. I use this after finishing my morning and night routine as a last step after my moisturizer. Not sure if it locks anything in but that is my purpose. It is a very light mist and has a slight but pleasant scent. No complaints. Seems to be a very nice product. I give it a few shakes before using to fully mix the product. I also have used this when I am short on time and can not apply my full skincare routine to give my skin some type of hydration. So far I like it and would recommend as a good backup serum when you need something quick.Great productI really like this spray! It makes me look very glowy. It doesnt feel watery too like a true serum even though its a spray.Spray for all seasons! ☺️
3935370000000,Gentle exfoliant  Leaves a nice glow without feeling harshThis was the first chemical exfoliater that  ever used. I was skeptical at first because I have super sensitive skin but it was great! It helped me get rid of blackheads while also keeping my skin moisturized and not drive my skin crazy!!This is a new type of exfoliator for my extra sensitive skin I just started to use it and so far Im happy with the results. My skin looks smoother and brighter without irritation.The first time I used this I wasnt sure it was working well because it seems to clump up before you even really rub it in but my skin is sooo smooth and soft after. I really enjoy this product now that I know what to expect. Its gentle but effective doesnt break me out or irritate my skin.Peeling gel. Ive seen a few videos where the gel is applied and it peels as its being worked into the skin. This PHA exfoliator in particular clumps up before being able to apply evenly throughout the face. My fingers are dry. I read the instructions. Why is it clumping up so quick? Nevertheless I worked the product into my skin. Doing so the product would fall off (because of it being clumped up). Whatever product i did manage to get on my face after washing it off it left my skin feeling okay. This product did not do well overall. The clumping and peeling should accur when being worked into the skin.
3935390000000,I use this for everything! My face my body hands Ive gone through BOTTLES of this stuff. Definitely something I utilize as a hydrating/moisturizing serum due to the texture. I will spritz a bit on my hands as well due to all of the hand washing then go in with a moisturizer or use on my body as a serum after my shower due to help with dry patches that appeared during the winter. Definitely a stapleI have very sensitive skin so I was happy to try it based on the reviews. at the beginning of using this product my eyes started to look brighter and I was so happy!. Now... my eyes are BURNING!!! I can only use it once a week but recently I cant even put it on. My eyes feel like they are on fire. I tried to wash it off but the stingy is still hereSpray is waaaay too aggressive and uneven but spraying on your hands and patting it in works perfectly (though that might defeat the point for some lol). Great extra step of moisturizing a tad bit oily but it sinks in fast. No scent which I likeThis stuff is amazing. I spray it on after toner/moisturizer and it keeps my skin hydrated all day.Great when you need some moisture after wearing a mask or just from general winter dryness.
3935400000000,I love this sunscreen so much it doesn�t leave a white cast at all and has a cooling effect when you put it on. Also leaves my skin looking so dewy!!My face isnt that sensitive but my eyes water like crazy with most products I use. So if you have sensitive eyes (or skin) give this a try and hopefully it works for you.I absolutely love this sunscreen. I have very dry sensitive skin as well as rosacea. Most sunscreens burn my face. This doesn�t at all. I Cant tell you how much I love it.I hope this never goes out of stock. I have been looking for a light sunblock that isn�t heavy on my skin spreads easily doesn�t leave a white cast and doesn�t make me breakout. This meets all of those!Really liked it
3942310000000,My skin has been out of whack with the change in weather and this is the first thing that seems to balance everything out! It absorbs quickly the actual face sheet is a good size (other ones always feel way too big!) and its not oversoaked in serum the way that I find others to be.Worked so well for my sensitive skin + combination skin! Plus the packaging is super cuteI usually like to put this mask on during my routine on sundays to reboot my skin before a new week starts.Feels refreshing and cooling. I love how much essence it has. Once placing the mask on my face i spread the rest down all over my neck and pat it dry.   Afterwards i do not deal with any excess drippingOrdered this after recieving a free bottle of their toner and this mask is pretty similar! Amazingly moisturizing and calming does exactly what it says. Plus the packaging is pretty cute.
3942320000000,I am not a fan of the pilling of this cleansing balm (the part that exfoliates). It seems like a normal cleansing balm but when you start to rub it on to your face the exfoliating pieces (feels/looks like pilling) get everywhere. When Im at the sink it gets all over the counter floor my clothes hair.. its just a mess (and Im not usually messy) and not an enjoyable experience for me. Other than the pilling it seems to be effective with removing makeup as a first (oil) cleanse. There is a lot of product in this jar so it will last for a while. Unfortunately I am not a fan.I have sensitive and combination skin thats more towards dry. I absolutely love the smell of this and it definitely peels and leaves my skin super soft but I found I cant use this more than once a week otherwise it dries my skin out too much even with a lot of moisturizing and my skin starts to feel raw.It is very nice on the skin. It removes the make up and skincare I have on with ease. Love the improvements my skin has shown.I just started using this cleansing balm and I really like it so far! its different from others that  tried - its slightly creamy and the exfoliating beads seem to be gentle enough for my sensitive skin.Gentle and added moisture
3943070000000,I really enjoyed this moisturizer. I woke up moisturized and helped reduce peeling on nights I use Tretinoin. However it didn�t work with my skin type on my off Tretinoin nights. It was too moisturizing. I think this would be great for a person with dry or combo skin type.This moisturizer is a solid workhorse in my skincare routine. I use it nightly after cleansing and applying treatments. I try to keep my nighttime skincare routine simple so I only use essence at night and tretinoin a few times a week. This moisturizer is able to effectively lock in the hydration from my essence all without irritating my skin. This is a repeat purchase for me and  even bought one for my dad.I have extremely reactive sensitive skin thats very dehydrated and normal to slightly dry. I love the texture of this its like a gel cream to me and effectively hydrates without feeling like theres a film. Its unscented but it has a strong like unscented product smell to it but it goes away after a minute.This moisturizer is the perfect combination of being lightweight and still moisturizing my skin well. Upon application this moisturizer feels lightweight like a gel cream but after it has dried the moisture of the moisturizer starts to sink in. Which feels amazing!I like the few ingredients. Smells a little like plastic when you first apply but fades quickly. A little sticky but hydrating.
3943080000000,I love how quickly this product dries and how light it is on.Clay masks in the past have dried me out leaving my skin tight and somehow even oiler than before. I thought I would give this a try - on a whim - to shrink and clean my pores. Im so glad I did. This mask dries well no crumbles and has a very subtle earthy smell. My skin feels almost squeaky clean when rinsing (all the oil sucked up) but when all done and dry my skin feels smooth and supple. I use this mask 2-3 times a week in the morning. It tightens my pores and leaves my skin texture and color balanced. Applies smooth and there is ample product for the price. This mask is now a part of my permanent routine.Helpful for irritated problematic acne-prone skin without drying out my skin. Also some light exfoliation but very mild non-abrasive green leaf bits which is very good for sensitive skin.I love this clay mask! Ive never tried mugworth before but Im glad I did! This is comparable to the Origins clay mask w/ honey. So it will go deep into your pores and get all the gunk out while moisturizing your skin! Unlike most clay masks this will nourish your skin while also sucking out the debris! It is also relatively cheap in comparison to the Origins one.Im very picky with my skincare ingredients but it seems like my skin loves anything mugwort. This mask doesn�t get tight on the skin & has a calming effect after applied. 10 minutes is all you need for this one & you don�t need a lot for application so this tube will go a long way.
4098700000000,I just turned 40 years old & I wish I found this Living Cleansing Balm before. It is so smooth & soft in your skin & particularly your eye area. Im glad I found this cleansing and will never go back to use the micellar waters that just dry out and burn your eyes. Ill be one of many more forever customers.Best Balm Ever. Works fast at removing makeup feels nice and smooth and does not leave that oily waxy buildup feeling. Love this stuff worth the price!This product is worth the hypeThis is by far the best Cleansing Balm Ive used. I love everything the texture the scent the color the effectiveness...My skin is happy and I cannot say more... Great job Charlotte Cho and team. ❤️used a lot of different cleansing foams oils and balms over the years with generally good results however this is the best one yet and is the first to give me immediately noticeable long standing amazing results. I�ll never use another cleanser from now on! I�d also highly recommend using the Then I Met You cleansing gel along with this.
4098780000000,great for my dry skinI damaged my skins moisture barrier using other products. This has helped me get my skin back to normal without causing me to break out and has soothed my irritated red skin. I plan to repurchase it when I run out -- definitely worth the price!Love this essence! its so soothing and moisturizing and I feel like its helping my redness.I have never tried an essence in my skincare routine before so this is my first time trying one. I have to say that I am very impressed with Missha�s formula. The essence is so amazing it calms any redness and hydrates my skin. My skin feels amazing and supple after using it and it surprisingly doesn�t have any scent to it and it did not break me out too. Will definitely repurchase in the future!I read the reviews on this and found that I wanted to give it a try so I ordered it. I have been using this after my toner and love it. I was very nervous at first on trying it being I have kind of sensitive skin but I have not had any bad reaction to this. I think it has worked a good deal with calming my very angry and purging pores. Finally I can say my face is happy with me yayyy!!
4098790000000,highly recommendedI love the effortlessness of this product. The misting pump makes use eas. I also saw an instant difference in the even texture of my skin.hydrating but not too much for my combination skin. It makes my skin feel refreshed and looks healthy and glowingI was looking for a mist to incorporate to my routine and this one is so hydrating and soothing. Makes my skin glow especially in this nyc winter weather.I prefer the essence much more compared to the mist. First off this product seems to have a more noticeable scent (not an earthy one but more like perfume). Never really noticed the scent with the essence though. It is definitely easier to apply but the spray is very localized so I feel like I end up using more than normal. However it functions the same. Great hydration and no negative reaction from my sensitive skin.
4118710000000,Love it so much and pairs great with my madeCera cream double essence toner!This is a lightweight moisturizer that goes on like a cool splash. It balances out any oiliness from face oils and lasts all day. its a nice switch for the spring/summer seasons.I am so glad Soko Glam put this back on the site. I fell in love with it and it was suddenly gone a couple months ago. This is the only thing that seems to work with my skin (Im oily dehydrated sensitive and acne-prone). This moisturizer helps keep me matte throughout the day while still being moisturizing. My skin was better than it has been in 10+ years when I was using this. Sadly when I had to find a substitute when it was no longer for sale my skin broke out in acne and it is very patchy and dry again while still being oily. I tried a few different products but nothing worked. I saw this was on the site again and I bought 4. I hope it sticks around!I use this as a daytime moisturizer when I want something light and fast-absorbing. It feels great under a layer of SPF and makeup and I dont have any issues with makeup slipping. A perfect everyday kind of moisturizer.struggled with terrible acne that just didn�t go away. I tried many products and they failed me horribly. I had the skin concierge with Zoe and she recommended a few products and I must say that I love them all! This cream is lightweight and helps keep my skin hydrated while also helping get rid of my acne and scars. There�s not much product it only lasted me for a month but its totally worth it!
4118720000000,It was an OK cleanser for me but it was a little bit drying to my face so I gave it to my sister who is not very into skincare but still have a one or two step routine to keep her skin controlled. This cleanser is a holy grail for her since it had helped her to reduce black heads and improve a little a bit her adult acne.Purchased for my niece to help with her teenage skin. Appears to be helping manage her skin.used really expensive cleansers in the past (first aid beauty philosophy tatcha...) and got tired of spending the money so I bought this one. its truly the most effective cleanser  purchased and while it might be irritating if you have acne it cleared mine up right away and actually did something for my pores without needing to use an oil based cleanser. Plus if you use it with hydrating products the dryness won�t be a problem. My skin tends to be on the sensitive/oilier side and even in winter this product does the trick without drying my skin out. Honestly super impressed and it feels great smells great and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth! Squeaky clean too!I was very excited to try this product because of the charcoal in it but I was a little disappointed with it. This is great as an exfoliating cleanser. My face always feels super clean and fresh after I use it and I noticed my blackheads on my nose has decreased in visibility but my face feels very tight after I use it. I always had to double up on my moisturizer because of how dry this was making my face after using it. Only a small amount is needed which is great because it lasts a long time. If this product could be fixed so that it is less drying I would buy it again because it does wonders on blackheads and pores.Was afraid it might be too drying or harsh for daily use but its been great! I use it nightly and feel squeaky clean after! The texture and foam is amazing.
4164940000000,I mainly bought this product to help with redness and texture. I have only used it a couple of times and I spread out my usage to about 1-2 times week but I can already see results. My skin looks and feels a lot smoother and the redness has gone down.Why didnt I find out earlier? It has helped me a lot with acne. The smell is a bit strong but its ok.These are the only pads that have worked to control my daughter�s hormonal acne. I cut one in half because the pads are huge and have so much serum in them. Amazing ingredients like salicylic acid & tea tree oil (for acne) licorice root extract camellia leaf extract aloe leaf and calendula extract (for soothing) . It also has moisturizing ingredients so it won�t dry out the skin. My son and I use these pads too and love them. I highly recommend these all in one pads!I normally hate how exfoliating feels but I love the two sided pads and just how much product is on each of the pads. Already came back to buy a back upI like to use these pads for when I dont use a face cleanser in the morning. This does a good job of cleaning my skin without stripping it and leaving it feeling semi hydrated on its own. Still need to put on a moisturizer after though. But I really like how my skin feels clean after using this because of its gentle exfoliation. The salicylic acid and tea tree oil in this does help with breakouts too. Two thumbs up!
4256250000000,I have genetic cystic acne and live in a extremely hot and dry environment which causes my skin to over produce oil (in another environment I think I would have normal/dry skin) that I have only just now gotten under daily control. I dont wear makeup regularly and tend to cleanse like I have oily skin and moisturize like I have dry skin and it has been working well for me.  Im not afraid of using oil Ive used oil to remove heavy eye makeup and I use a home made oil moisturizer a few times a week on top of my regular moisturizer depending how my skin feels. But the idea of using oil to clean oil felt strange and I didnt expect to like this.  But I do! It smells great (I expected something eggs or weird)  its silky and spreads nicely and it doesnt leave me feeling greasy like I expected and oil cleanser to do. Even if I didnt follow it with a foam cleanser I would have been very pleased with it. Even after cleansing and before doing anything else my skin looked great not red or irritated.Im very oily at my T zone and normal on the perimeter of my face. My pores are prominent on my nose and cheeks so I thought this would be great to incorporate into my skincare routine to cleanse my pores. Ive been using it for a few weeks and I havent seen any changes to my skin. Im not a fan of the watery consistency because it feels unstable to go from palm to face. Smells good like everyone says. But thought it was an average product overall.I had high hopes for this product but ultimately there are better oil cleansers available for less money that more effectively improve the appearance of pores. Smells lovely though.I really enjoy using this oil cleanser. I love the smell and how easy it is to use. I give it stars all around.Very nice formula and leaves skin feeling very clean
4335660000000,I got this eye cream because I loved the toner and serum so much and after just 3 days of use I can already see brightening effects. Will order again but probably not for awhile because its such a big tube!its a little early to see the full effects of this cream but I have been using it about a month and so far I like it. I have more mature skin dark circles and lines. Nothing shifts the darkness but this cream is nourishing non irritating and plays well under spf and make up. Plus its a big tube. I will purchase again.Its really good it doesnt burn or irritate my eyes but I feel I could use a heavier creamIve always had dark circles/puffiness under my eyes (probably a result of genetics) but theyd gotten worse since starting grad school. But Ive been using a little bit of this product every night the past couple of weeks and my roommate turned to me the other day and told me that Id been looking significantly less tired recently! All credit is given to this eye cream (since theres been a lot of late nights lately with the end of the semester so I know its not because Ive been getting more sleep)!I bought this with the matching toner which I love and was replacing an empty. I was super excited because I thought there was no way it could go wrong since the toner was great with my extra dry sensitive skin. It went on great and I didn�t notice any irritation. The next day my entire eye area was burnt and continued to peel off for the next week. No idea why this happened as I don�t have any known allergies and I use the toner every day. Just a heads up in case this happens to anyone else- and why you should always test new products one at a time! This was my first time reaching out to Soko Glam to make a return and it was flawless. Thanks Soko Glam! Cant wait to try another eye cream.
4337070000000,Just a nice refreshing watery toner than has a very light refreshing. Has a very mild astringency that goes away almost immediately leaving my skin feeling clean and toned.Love it!It smells nice but its not earth shattering. My skin is neither better nor worse.This toner is so gentle and so wonderful. I switched to it recently when I also bought the Fresh Herb Origin Cream. This has helped so much to make my skin feel soft and smoother as well as helping to sooth my sensitive skin irritation. My skin has been clearer and so much better! Soko Glam - you have to keep this one - it is so amazing!! My new go to!My skin gets a little tingly and not quite irritated but a little bumpy after I put this on. I didn�t feel it prepared my skin for the next step very well either. My skin doesn�t seem to like toners with these main ingredients so this one was a no for me.
4337090000000,Makes skin soft and no irritations.I havent tried using these to remove make up so I cant speak on that. I noticed the key ingredients for these are similar to the toning pads. So for about a week now Ive been using these pads as a post cleansing toner since Ive run out of my regular toner and theyve worked great. I dont know if Im actually supposed to rinse after using but I havent LOL I use a retinol based serum for my hormonal acne and it hasnt had a bad reactions with it. I also have to say that these have been really great in hydrating my face my skin is parched in the winter.Es un producto que me gusta mucho facil de usar y efectivo lo recomiendoI received this as a birthday gift. Thank you Soko Glam! I know the description and directions state that these are “cleansing” pads but I would go one (or two) steps further with my cleansing routine. I don�t feel that these should in any way shape or form replace the cleansing step as they do not cleanse that well this coming from someone whom doesn�t wear foundation and on occasion mascara and eyeliner.  had them for over a month and  tried using them twice instead of double-cleansing and my skin was not happy. My skin needs actual water to start the hydration process which these do not supply. I believe that these pads would be okay to “refresh” the skin midday or after a workout until you can get home to actually wash your face but the jar is huge and isn�t travel-friendly.I thought this would like a pre-soaked cleansing water pads thing so I wouldnt have to rinse afterwards. Unfortunately you DO have to rinse it off afterwards so its not the best item in terms of convenience.  It does provide a good cleanse though and I feel pretty refreshed afterwards. Its useful if you like to have more control over where your cleansing product ends up on your face. With pads you can target specific areas way easier. Also I have long hair and its always a pain when I end up wetting my bangs with product (and later water for a wash) just because I want to make sure a cleansing product covers my whole face. So I think this can be pretty useful for mornings when youre in a rush.
4339090000000,I like how simple and hydrating this essence is. It could sting a little bit if you have a pretty stressed skin but I also have sensitive skin so I only put a little bit. I also like how it doesnt have a strong smell.I have been wanting to try this essence for some time and I finally got around to getting it. The packaging is beautiful the essence itself is a pretty berry pink color. I use it every morning for about 2 weeks now and it makes my skin very soft and keeps me refreshed!I wasnt sure how I would like this or if I even really needed it in my routine. I love the cleansing oil so I thought Id give this a try. My complexion is noticeably brighter smoother and more calm since using this essence. It has become a staple for sure!Ive been using this product for 5 months and am now on my second bottle im in love! This essence is so good for my dry acne prone skin I have noticed such a difference in my acne both the amount and size of my spots since starting to use this. seriously if you struggle with acne look into essences like this with probiotics and ferments you can thank me laterI love this essence so much. Ive really noticed a difference in my skin since I started using Then I Met You products and Im sure this essence is the star of the show. It is pricey but it lasts a long time/a little goes a long way. The liquid also has a very luxurious feeling to it not as watery as most essences Ive tried but not as thick as the serums I use - a happy medium. It just feels really nice on the skin most definitely pairs well with the Birch Milk Refining toner. Some major differences I noticed since using it my skin was prepped really well for days Id put on makeup my skin felt moisturized throughout the day on days I did not wear makeup and my skin is looking less dull and actually retaining its liveliness very well. Definitely the best essence Ive tried in my skincare journey so far.
4347220000000,Love this. I leave it on for about 15 mins and my skin feels so soft and glows after. I follow up with my usual skin care routine after. It is an amazing exfoliant and I use it once a week and will repurchase.I was curious to see what sesame milk can do for my skin. The scent (while not sesame but very perfumed “clean” soapy scent) is strong buy I don�t mind it. I think this might be a gentle exfoliation product that will take a few weeks for it to actually show a difference. Towards the end of my most recent masking it started to make my cheeks a bit itchy.I am a huge fan of clay masks especially the ones that do not turn hard and crunchy. Stays soft and easy to wash off. I usually leave on for 10-15mins and absolutely love. Your skin feels smooth and a tad brighter. It does have a scent so if your sensitive to smells you may not like it. its nice to use one or twice a week. My sister loves it too. The packaging it comes in is pretty cute as well. Definitely worth a try!This was the first enzyme mask Ive used and I love it. Its gentler than an acid (and you dont have to worry as much about your active ingredients not playing well together) but with all the regenerative benefits. There is a slight improvement in the tone and texture of my skin and Im sure Ill see more with continued use. Im glad I added to my skincare routine!Ive been using this once a week since I got it. I picked it because I thought it would be less irritating and help keep my skin moisturized. My skin does feel very smooth after using but my skin is red for a while afterward so I have been using it at night. I think I will keep looking for something a little less irritatingbut that is not saying it is not a good product. I am just older with more sensitive skin.
4347480000000,Leaves my skin moisturized but its not quite amazing based on what Im seeing right nowI will be honest I didnt even try this on my face. I did however test it with my fingers and while it feels super smooth silky and moisturizing  its smell is to me awful. To me it smells like oil paints and I cant put that on my face because I know I will hate it.Hi there   Im so sorry to hear that this cleanser was not a good fit! Our team is happy to provide assistance. Please reach out to hellosokoglam.com about this product along with your order number. Thanks! )It doesnt have any scents which I like. It goes on nicely on the skin. It is now one of my favorite balm cleansers.I got this originally as a free gift with purchase and it sat in my bathroom drawer for months - a shame because I ended up loving it! I used it when my previous oil wash (not from SokoGlam) ran out and I couldnt get to stores. I figured I would use this for a day or two... Im on my second tub now and havent looked back! My two issues with it- smallish size goes quickly (though I may use too much still working out exactly how much I need each time) and I just dont like oil cleansers in a tub overall. However the benefits outweigh all that and I will continue to use this product! I have a lot less of those little gray filaments in my pores that I thought I would never get rid of and find it very soothing with a nice melty texture. I have seen improved skin texture as well as softer skin and fewer breakouts. I enjoy using this and it definitely helps me make sure I cleanse morning and night. I use a little extra if I have been wearing makeup. Its very effective and has a pleasant barely-there non-scent type thing going on! Going to continue to purchase.
4347570000000,I love this stuff! Takes away the redness and leaves my face with a touch of glow. I like to wear alone or sometimes I mix a little bit with my other sunscreens. Doesnt break me out or irrritate my skin. I highly recommend!its so glowy and pretty without being greasy. I love it for barefaced skin days!I Love this sun screen. It goes on smooth and doesnt leave a white cast on my skin. Sun Project Shimmer Sun Essence gives my skin a subtle glow and leaves it looking health and radiant.I recently added sun protection to my daily routine (should have done that a long time ago!) and was really pleasantly surprised by how light this feels on my skin! Often sunscreens can feel heavy and you can see the layer of whiteness on your face but not this one!I purchased this for a friend who is new to k-beauty/skincare. She expressed that she has extremely reactive/sensitive/dry skin and that she stopped using spf because the one she had at home caused her skin to burn. I was impressed by the reviews from other sensitive skin customers so I decided to take a gamble. My friend is loving this product. She said her skin feels hydrated there is no white cast and she loves the subtle glow it gives her. Next time I need to re-up on spf I will definitely try this product!
4356060000000,Im on an oral retinoid (Acitretin / Soriatane) so my lips are incredibly dry and chapped. This product actually dried my lips out more than before I started using it. Also it unevenly and I was hoping that due to having an applicator built-in as opposed to being in a jar that would mean I could not only avoid touching my mouth more in order to smear it around. However I not only is that a necessity I also need to touch the angled ampule applicator itself where so much of it wants to remain due to how goopy it is. Despite how thick it is and it looks very shiny it dries up very quickly without feeling like any moisture has sunk into my lips themselves. With all the lip oils balms moisturizers masks treatments etc. I have used in my lifetime when my lips have been healthy or chapped I would re-label this as a clear gloss with moisturizing benefits as it probably does moisturize healthy lips a bit and falls more under the make-up category than the skincare category.I really like this lip ampule. My only problem is it doesn�t leave my lips moisturised for very long. I live in a pretty dry climate so chapped lips is a regular issue and finding the right lip moisturiser is a journey. That being said I really like this lip ampule and have bought it twice because I like it that much.I love the texture of this stuff but I wouldnt wear it during the day only at night. It does have a bit of a scent if youre very sensitive to smell.I originally really liked this gloss because it is thick and occlusive - perfect as a nighttime lip mask. After a week of consistent use my lips are dry and cracking and I am overall disappointed that I will have to stop using this product. I would return it but based on the price and estimated refund it just isnt worth it.This is an incredibly occlusive balm that I enjoyed using at first but a week into using the product my lips started to peel and were overall much drier than when I just used vaseline. I am disappointed that it did not work better and it just isnt worth the hassle of returning.
4359700000000,Super hydrating. Only need a small amount to absorb into the skinI am used to using a more creamy moisturizer and this is more gel like. However it is very moisturizing and has evened out the redness and irritation  had going on. Goes on nice before an SPF. its a toss up whether I like this one or the Klairs Fundamental Water Gel Cream more.The skin concierge recommended this product and Im so glad they did! I was a little hesitant at first because of the price tag and having tried many other moisturizers that didn�t work I was expecting the same... but this is the real deal. It only takes such a small amount the jar will last for months but the benefits were noticeable for me after the first application. I like that there is no smell and it is light and breathable on my skin. I will buy again and again!This cream is super hydrating non oily and non irritating. It doesnt break me out and many things do. A very little goes a very long way its def worth the priceI have sensitive and dry skin and this has been really nice. The old moisturizer i was using changed their ingredients and added a scent that caused my skin to get irritated so i decided to try this. It is not irritating at all. It has no fragrance which is a plus for me. It gives your skin a natural feeling. Sometimes if i have really dry spots on my cheeks from the mandatory face coverings i will apply another layer just in those areas to help. I think i will definitely buy this again.
4362170000000,Ive been using this for about 2 weeks and my skin looks so good.Fav vitamin C!very niceIve been using this for a few weeks now and am noticing the sun spots on my face are fading. Im excited to see it work over the next few months. If you are incorporating Vit C for the first time into your skincare regimen I would suggest using just once a day every few days and then working your way to more frequent use. When I first got the serum I made the mistake of using it every day for a few days and noticed it was drying out my skin. Now I use it in the mornings every other day with a decent amount of moisturizer + spf and it is doing wonders for my skin.Im so bummed. My vitamin c turned orange fast. I know there is a certain way to store these kind of serums. I stored mine in our family bathroom in a dark drawer but it didnt last long. I didnt know if I can continue using it / I better ask the skin care concierge.
4367430000000,CalmingMy skin gets so glowy and refined after using this mask. Plus the remaining serum lasts for days!I used this mask last night for 20 minutes & my face felt so good I bought the essence. I woke up this morning and my skin still feels so soft (one of the first times this winter!) We live at a high elevation and this winter has been so tough on my hormonal acne + face. I wish I had used this mask sooner because the redness has gone down and I didnt wake up with my skin feeling tight.  I will say that the smell has lingered too. Its a light scent but Im not a fan of scents at all. But my skin feels so good Im willing to use the essence every day! Thanks Soko Glam for sending this to me in one of your sheet mask collections!My skin feels and looks healthierOne of the best masks cica really does wonders for your skin.
4367460000000,I use this at night after my skin care routine and  noticed a dramatic improvement in my rosacea and overall brightness in my skin. It smells amazing is lightweight but feels moisturizing and it doesn�t leave an oily feel. its been an incredible product for me.This product is very hydrating. My skin felt great after every time I used it. I used this daily and it lasted for quite some time. The fragrance is pleasant. I would buy this again.Looove this! Idk why the ratings arent perfect 5 stars. With my combo skin Im able to get great dewy skin from this. Best of all on my oily areas it doesnt make those areas super greasy like other hydrating focused moisturizers. Its light too and doesnt feel like another heavy layer of skin care on your face )never really cared about moisturizers since I always use a bunch of serums/essence in my routine but this was the first moisturizer I ever really enjoyed. Texture is dreamy and smooths onto the skin so well. It saved my super dehydrated skin after giving birth. its like giving your skin 8 cups of water. My skin feels so smooth and supple in the morning after using this.Begin to break out
4367470000000,I have quite acne prone skin & I felt like this was pretty soothing. Was hoping to use this in the mornings along with at night but cant because it leaves me sticky & thus oily...i got this as a secondary moisturizer for breakouts but ended up using it full time. i was shocked by how light it was and how well it absorbs. a little does go a long way so its lasted quite a whileI have had my breakouts under control for a long time now but after using this moisturizer for 2 weeks I was full of acne even a month later.I added this into my current skin care routine after running out of my previous moisturizer and it has melded flawlessly. Its lightweight not overly scented and helps keep my skin moisturized without clogging my pores. Its also helped balance my combination skin without leaving me super greasy in my T zone. I recommend it!hello i purchased this product & received it 1/07 and within 2 days i see a major difference in my acne. My face has been smoother and hydrated no more redness less acne build up at the end the day. Especially being a work and wearing a mask for 8hrs has been horrible to my skin and my skin was doing just fine before the pandemic. I use this as a facial cleanser as well in the morning and mask at night. This product really does helps control the excess sebum.
4381260000000,Very glossy and a bit sticky. Doesnt stay around too long. Nice smell though.I wouldnt recommend this if youre looking for something moisturizing but this is good if you want an exfoliating lip mask that you can leave on overnight. It took a few weeks of using it at least every other night to realize that I no longer had chapped lips ever and was never reaching for lip scrubs anymore. And using it every other night or so has made this tiny tube last fairly long. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because it does dry quicker than other lip masks and I received this as a free gift but would hesitate to buy it at full price. Overall would recommend as an exfoliating lip mask.Just the right amount of sticky smells great. feels gorgeous!I have tried the Laniege Lip Mask and I fell in love with it and I have also tried the Tatcha Kissu Lip Mask but that was way too thick and sticky. This is a perfect to-go version and its lightweight and moisturizing!I purchased the cleansing duo (Caroline made me do it) and treated myself to this one as well and I love it! It is good in that sence that its not nessecary to apply it all the time ergo it works.
4422860000000,Ive been struggling the past couple weeks with using a higher strength tretinoin and nothing was helping the really dry cracked peeling skin around my mouth. I decided to try this to see if it might help anything that is milky I am automatically drawn to because it looks soothing. IMMEDIATE results. What I have been battling for 2 weeks was cleared up overnight with the addition of this. I will definitely keep this in my rotation!This is the best toner ever.Love it!So I have to admit that at first I did not like this product. I was using it in the winter when I usually layer a lot of products and felt like it was too much. Well fast forward to me starting retinol and my skin was in desperate need of hydration. it was not only dry but painful! My skin burned when I applied my usual products. Nothing I had was doing the trick so I decided to switch back to this toner and I immediately noticed results. My skin felt smooth and moisturized and it even soothed some small blemishes I was developing. So happy I kept this one around! My skin is finally comfortable again. Highly recommend if youre experiencing any dryness or transitioning with retinol or any other harsh products.It instantly soaks in your skin making it feel smooth without being oily.
4423860000000,This is a really nice sunscreen its easy to spread light weight it has some physical sunscreen (zinc titanium) most spf 50s are hard to spread and very thick this one is not like that. its so so good it wear good under make up too. I have combination skin more towards the drier side it also feels very nice on your skin.I really wanted to love this sunscreen however it has a lot of white overcast and is lavender scented. The scent does dissipate over time. I do break out sometimes when using this not horrible maybe a pimple or two and not all the time. To offset the white cast I use a cushion compact to go over sunscreen. I use this one to use on days when I run out of my neogen sunscreen. I do feel like it gives a lot of sun protection as it coats the skin very well.Absolutely does not pass the 2 finger test for white cast. I usually have to put on slightly less spf than I normally do to mitigate it. As other reviews say it does absorb but even after absorbing and rubbing it in I still get a bit of a white cast and I dont consider myself to be that tan. Unsure if the other people who say it doesnt have a white cast are either very fair or not putting on enough product (you always have to apply ~2 fingers worth of spf to make sure youre properly protected by the sun!). The satin-like finish and formula other than the white cast is actually pretty nice however. In regards to the fragrance I personally do not mind it but it is strong for those who are sensitive to that. So unless you are very fair-skinned or constantly wear makeup over your spf and you are not sensitive to fragrance I dont recommend this product. There are plenty of other spfs on this website that are more melanin friendly.Does not leave a white residue when applying. It actually applies nicely and smoothly. No smell and does not clog my pores like other spf! I highly recommend this!!!Ive used this product for a couple of weeks now and i see some differences in my skin! It does leave a tiny bit of a white cast but after fully massaging it into my skin it does fade almost completely away. It does not have any particular smell in it which means it does not contain fragranes which is that i prefer. It has not broken me out or leave my eyes stinning. Sits well under makeup!
4423870000000,I look 5 years younger and my eyes feel so nourished. Would definitely recommend this product.I will be buying this forever. I got a free sample packet in and order and immediately loved it. Though it feels different in application (fells amazing soft and lux btw) the results are the same as a strivectin r&r eye cream (68$) my mom gave me. I even tried one on each eye and you cant tell the difference. Plus its a tube which I love way more than a jar.I love the results I have gotten from this eye cream. I have really bad dark circles but after using this product I can see a difference!This is the thickest eye cream Ive ever used its kinda hard to spread definitely doesnt glide on. I usually pat on my eye creams but for this one I have to rub (gently of course). I try to use it while Ive still got some essence or toner on my face to make it spread easier. Now this might just be me but within a week of using this my milia went away totally smoothed out. I have been using just a tiny tiny amount at night because its so thick.Ive been using it for about a month and chicken skin-like bumps started appearing under my eyes. The same thing happened to my husband.
4429670000000,I had some stress acne recently so I used this serum with the Beauty of Joseon calming serum. This serum is a bit heavier than the calming serum but when I put this on my skin it easily sinks into the skin and leaves a nice glow to the skin. With the combination of the two serums my acne has been reduced to fading hyperpigmentation.This serum is rich moist and thick. It does seem to improve dryness and hydration. Overnight I have seen a reduction of redness and more even tone. Looking forward to more benefits over time.Good product.This serum gives my skin an instant glow and the bottle is also so pretty.  been waking up with oilier than usual skin since using this product but still hoping it lives up to its great reviews.After using Glowing serum I feel that my skin is full of life. The glow effect is amazing!
4477080000000,Theres a lot of product and really hydrates your skin. My skin felt supple after.I didnt notice any difference after using. No breakouts but nothing special.An extremely hydrating cooling mask that leaves my face super soft and plump after usage. I love the ingredients!I love it.Thank you.I love the fermentation line from Benton so I had to try this out. It helped my skin feel firmer and more hydrated.
4477200000000,This really do work but I need 1 that cover my whole cheek  I side sleeper so this run out really quick (Ive used different brands in the past and none compare to this one in terms of price effectiveness and invisibility. I wear it out and people have said that they dont notice it on my face.Does the job for my maskne! Its so smooth and invisible I almost forget when I have it on!These are perfect to use over night. Theyre really thin but in a good way!These work great on my problem pimples and I like that its not irritating on my skin.
4480000000000,Good productThese have Transformed my nightly cleansing routine. Love!Fantastic! Easy face washing pads cuts through makeup and oil wonderfully.I had a bunch of tiny bumps on my forehead which after doing some research seemed like comedonal acne. A Soko glam skin consultant recommended using these to exfoliate a couple times a week.  used this for about 2 months 2-3 times a week and the bumps are almost fully gone.I am a student and dont have a big budget. This is a really good when used as physical exfoliation every 2-3 nights a week. Im looking forward to try out more from this line) (It leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped and the next moring it always looks super bright with less acne)
4498900000000,I have combination/oily skin. I love the ingredients in this and really wanted to love it but I think its just okay for me. I dont think its caused breakouts and it does make my skin feel moisturized. However it does dry down to a kind of sticky feeling that Im not a huge fan of. If you wear full coverage foundation Im not sure how itd work with this. I usually just use a tinted moisturizer though or concealer so I might be able to overlook the sticky feeling because those products still go on fine. But I do feel like this lotion makes me look more slick than dewey as well so with the slick look and the sticky feeling I dont think Ill be repurchasing. But for someone with less oily skin and who doesnt mind the slight tacky feeling I think this is a great lotion.I love wearing this at night because it is very light and you can feel it soaking into your skin. In the mornings I like a moisturizer that makes my skin more dewy. But if you like something that absorbs quickly this is perfect.This is so lightweight and leaves my skin looking so hydrated & dewy. It takes a while for it to absorb but once it does i look amazing. A little goes a long way. I have acne prone skin and this did not make me breakout or have a scent to it. It comes with a little scooper.I have never seen or used a texture like this its the perfect blend of lightness and moisturizing. It has a very light pleasant smell. Totally recommend!I didnt like the consistency of the gel cream.
4498930000000,With all the great ingredients my skin is firm brighter smooth & radiant just after one week.. I loved this best serum... highly recommended!!Very lightweight on my face. I use both of the pumps together and one pump is enough for one application for me. This lasts a very long time so worth the purchase.  Makes me look very glowy. I use it with the Neogen probiotics moisturizer.This product is really hydrating and fairly moisturizing as well. I mixed the serums together and loved the results- bouncy healthy skin! Fyi there are TONS of extracts and it definitely has a scent so super sensitive types might want to avoid.I have a very very dry skin so I have to use oil for my night skincare routine. So I only use this product in the morning. This product is hydrating - in a gentle and delightful way also pretty light but in a way that it really works to hydrate my skin. I really recommend this product. I am not too familiar with probiotics in skincare but I think its worth trying!Goes on nice and light-not heavy or greasy.
4498950000000,I love how my face feels ♥️It leaves such a nice glow and leaves your skin feeling plump. everyone compliments my face when I wear it during the day. I would wear it at night but I typically dont.Didnt know how much this moisturizer helped my skin until I finished the jar! Made my skin look hydrated and healthy (used it after cleanser toner and serum). I hate heavy creams but this one absorbed in pretty quickly. Im trying a new moisturizer now and my skin does not compare to when I was using this. The scent is a bit stronger than what Im used to but its a pleasant one as others have described - a refreshing start for the day. My skin type is sensitive combo and breaks out easily.This has such a light texture and a nice scent. I received this as a deluxe sample and will be purchasing it. Ive been on the hunt for a lighter moisturizer and I think this is it. Its moisturizing light and a little goes a long way.this has both the smell and texture of those little jelly cups which is amusing. I got the trial size and I loved it. A little goes a long way and its so lightweight it didnt leave me greasy but also left me feeling moisturized all day! the only thing however is that I didnt notice any notable difference including this in my routine which is too bad.
4498960000000,Its a good toner . I have very dry and sensitive skin and have tried a lot of different toners that only made my skin dryer or irritated but this toner hydrated my skin well without irritating itJust incorporated this into my routine my skin looks more even and takes product better now!This toner has quickly decongested and hydrated my super sensitive skin and causes no stinging or dryness. I have highly reactive skin with rosacea that can flare for no reason and stings like hell with the application of nearly every product – but  been fine with the Pearlstation toner. At first the tea tree smell alarmed me but its balanced perfectly with the other ingredients – all excellent for imparting hydration (and you won�t smell it after about a minute). My skin – after only 10 days – looks much brighter. If AHAs and BHAs are too potent for you give this a try. Im so pleased I finally found something that works and doesn�t hurt!Bought this toner to help me manage my acne breakouts. I was worried the tea tree smell would be too overwhelming but it has a well balanced scent. It is more gentle. It doesnt help with an angry pimple but it does help manage smaller less crazy ones.I really like this but I think Ill try something a little more hydrating because I have incredibly dry and sensitive skin
4500100000000,I used this as a two-step mask and cleanser. Right after I washed my face with it my skin was shockingly soft. Maybe its because my skin is a bit on the oilier side of the combination spectrum but I didn�t get dried out by the cleanser at all. However I definitely didn�t feel oily after using it. It made my face look fresher than Im used to. This will be a go-to.I bought this after trying the sample in a recent order from Soko Glam. I fell in love with the texture and how smooth my skin was afterwards. I find this way easier to use than the stuff I use from Aztec Secret Healing Clay. I will sometimes leave it on for 10 mins to use as a mask but mostly just as my water-based cleanser step. Highly recommend!Dries quick foams up well and leaves my skin silky.I got this as a sample and was impressed with how clear my skin looked with just the sample that I bought it recently. It really clears out my skin like no other but unlike a few other reviews I did find it a bit drying and my skin would feel tight. It was nothing a good moisturizer couldn�t fix but makes me hesitant to use it more than once a day. Not sure how well this removes make up because I did use it after using an oil and balm cleanser (mostly for eye make up) but brightens my skin so much that I don�t feel the need to use foundation. Highly recommend as a mask as well. Definitely worth trying out!It applies like a creamy clay mask and is very good detoxifying the skin and then it washes off perfectly cleansing the skin gently and isnt - at all - stripping.
4500120000000,I havent noticed any massive improvements in terms of acne control and it is making my skin purge (likely for the best tho!) but after use my pores are much smaller and my face is smoother healthier and less oily. Plus it leaves my face tingly and clean without feeling too tight or dry!   Im looking forward to seeing if it can help control my acne and oily skin after long-term use.After a few months of using this toner I noticed that my pores got smaller and I had fewer blackheads on my nose.Im surprised this doesn�t have more reviews! This toner changed the game for me. I have received so many compliments about my skin and I know its b/c of this product. I have oily skin mostly t-zone and I have noticed that I don�t get as oily during the day! My pores are slightly smaller and my skin just looks smooth overall. I use daily at night after I double cleanse! I only apply moisturizer right after - I noticed a huge difference after 4 weeks!!My skin is smoother and morel even after using this toner!  noticed my dark spots are also fading.I can tell this is a good product. Im just not a fan of the essential oils.
4500130000000,I absolutely love the way this masks feels on my lips! I use it as a light lip balm during the day and a mask in the evening... Lips have never felt so luscious! I highly recommend this product.Ive been using SO many lip balms/masks my favorite was the classic laneige lip mask. The squeezey tubes are convenient and hygienic compared to a tub or pot however I decided to try this and I am in love! It feels VERY hydrating and my lips ALWAYS feel smooth after using this. I seldomly experience flakey lips now!its so moisturizing and nurturing!Pleasant lightly-scented balm without any heavy sticky gooey mess. It goes on smooth as silk and helps to hydrate combat dryness and fixes mildly chapped lips. However if you�re expecting this to resolve harshly cracked lips extreme winter conditions or want an overnight quick-fix - its probably not the best solution. I do find myself sometimes reapplying it during the night but it does its job and works well as a nightly maintenance routine.This has been an absolute game-changer. The first time I applied it before bed I woke up without chapped lips for the first time in my life!!!  I use it every night and am so so so thankful for this product. Also it has a very light calming smell and you only need a tiny amount so it lasts for a while!
4505010000000,Ive been enjoying these as my AM cleanse. They have a pleasant aroma and help to freshen and brighten my complexion for the rest of the day. Ive also used them after a workout or if I feel I need a bit more of a scrub for my PM routine.I thought since this was designed as a makeup removing wipe that it�d be safe around the eye area but sadly I found out the hard way that isn�t so. its highly effective at removing layers of liquid lipstick and tints and the ingredients are a lot more pleasant than similar products. Also its able to clean off my SPF setting spray concealer color corrector and base layer of sunscreen WITHOUT and struggle or irritation. You MAYBE COULD use it around your eye area but when it dripped into mine the citrusy ingredient must have not agreed. Luckily the MEDIHEAL Eye and Lip wipes remove my stubborn waterproof makeup so I suggest using them in conjunction if you don�t mind.So far so great. It cleanses without making my skin feel tight and stripped. There is a very light citrus like scent. Welcome addition to any travel bag. I will need to find a container to transfer it into since the jar is too large to lug around.
4505780000000,My skin is too sensitive for traditional acid toners (aha/bha stuff) but the papaya enzymes in this play very well with my skin. Its my favorite product from Good Skin Days and I use it all over my torso for my back and décolletage acne. Cotton pad for the face and just my palms for everywhere else.Love it! Gentle and cleansing. Ive seen a difference in my skin texture and acne scars since starting to use.What I love about this product is how quickly it absorbs. It also provides hydration without stickiness or pilling. Ive been using it for a few months and havent noticed any significant changes in my skin but its certainly not doing any harm either. The price point is also good for the amount of product you get.Works well no irritation hydrating very mild exfoliating ingredients and leaves my skin moist. I got this as a reward and have been using it during these cold winter months to fend off dryness. While I liked it I do prefer a few others as they work better for my sensitive combo skin especially in the warmer seasons.Its my perfect toner after remove my makeup. Dont irritate mi skin and feels fresh and free of impurities.  Es mi toner perfecto para después de remover el maquillaje. No me irrita la piel se siente fresca y limpia de impurezas.
4516920000000,Love all your products. My skin has never felt so soft and looked so moisturized!I mix it with my moisturizer for a glowy lookLove this oil the skin looks more bright not greasy. Help with the dry areasI have been feeling dry lately and use this as the last step in my night routine. I love how moisturizing it feels and it locks in my other layers. It gives me a glowy look that I dont love for daytime but at night its perfect. In the morning my skin doesnt feel dry at all.I got this oil as a gift and it has been my life saver since then. My skin is very sensitive and dry and this oil does a perfect job in deeply hydrating my skin.
4551280000000,My skin is not perfect from this yet but it will be! I have always had acne prone skin ranging from minor areas of just a couple spots to larger patches if it is humid/I have to wear a mask frequently. Other products have helped but only certain areas of my face or have been less effective with time. Now my blemishes that my dermatologist said were impossible to get rid of its just part of how your skin is are reduced to merely an area of skin that is slightly redder than the rest of my face- the best and fastest results I have ever gotten. My hope is that with continued use of this and my everyday exfoliating toner I really will have clear skin eventually! It does usually sting a little upon application but is not painful and the results are very worth it. I havent experienced any drying out or irritation. I use this 3-4 times a week sometimes in the morning sometimes at night. It works either way for me and I ALWAYS follow up with a good moisturizer. If you dont moisturize well after application you probably will experience some drying. I am so happy to have found this product and given it a chance. Heres to new skin (and a new dermatologist)!tried many exfoliators physical chemical combination ones. This is so gentle but it really does work excellently! I use this a couple times a week and my skin has really evened out.  been one to over exfoliate before and I like how gentle this is but also with powerful results. The hyaluronic acid helps to keep moisture in so you don�t end up with a red splotchy face like some exfoliated do. I wipe this on my face gently with a cotton wipe and even though I notice results right away I can really tell a difference the next day. This is by far my favorite exfoliated  ever tried.I absolutely love how my skin feels the morning after I use this. And its been getting smoother and smoother as I work my way through this bottle. You won�t be sorry!Don�t see much of a difference but I�ll use it til its gone. Probably won�t buy again. Didn�t realize its more like a toner base.I accidentally over-exfoliated with another product and as part of my course correction to get my skin back on track I bought this. Layered under serums and moisturizer its help keep my skin clear and less irritated. Im really liking it so far and have been using it 1 or 2 times a week for about a month.
4552630000000,its a rich creamy texture but feels light fresh and cooling on the skin. It makes my skin moisturized and calm and my texture looks smooth and GLASSY! It DOES have some white cast so darker skinned people may not like it. Im very fair so it actually helps tone down redness that�s only on my face so my face matches my body better. Also the scent is very faint (apple/mint?) it doesn�t breakout or irritate my sensitive skin it has a subtle sheen and cooperates with makeup well. It has no oil controlling properties so my oily skin can get a little too shiny some days but my skin does that with anything. Im on my 6th tube now yes I recommend it!Ive been using Cell Fusion C Laser Sunscreen this winter. Its great. It protected my skin from the sun and cold but as the weather started warming it felt too heavy. It would be great for dry skin year round. The Ipkn is lighter weight and still gives the same SPF50 in a generous size tube. My skin is fairly sensitive and I havent had any irritation at all. It works perfectly under my Missha BB foundation. Ill be using this through the warmer months.This really makes applying sunscreen a pleasant experience. The smell is so delicious the cream glides on smoothly and is very hydrating. Love the subtle color correcting and gives me a dewy glow. Will definitely continue to use this!Fantastic sunscreen- lightweight absorbs quickly and I love that�s slightly color correcting. I have sensitive skin/rosacea so I was concerned about the scent but so far it hasn�t bothered me at all. My skin is very happy with this product!This is the first product Ive bought on soko glam that I have not liked. It has a nice scent and thats the only good thing I can say. It left my face as white as a sheet and is very drying. No moisture at all. Will definitely not repurchase.
4554440000000,No lie. At least 10 of those off is genetic but the rest? It comes from this. Light scent easy absorption and my partner says my face has never felt this soft. Will purchase again!This is the only cream that has actually helped solve my dry skin + keep it solved! It has an interesting texture thick but elastic almost like marshmallow creme - its odd at first to use but spreads fairly easily and soaks in fast leaving my skin feeling moisturized for hours! I also notice my skin feels firmer and my fine lines are reduced.  Also it smells utterly divine and a little goes a long way!The only thing I dont like about this cream is that it sometimes stings areas of my face if I dont have another moisturizer on underneath (I have extremely sensitive skin). I wonder if its from the fragrance but I absolutely love the way this cream smells!! I just need to remember to put another moisturizer on underneath to act as more of a buffer. Same with the under eye area if I apply this cream right after washing yet it claims to be an undereye cream also. Other than the sometimes stinging I do love how this cream absorbs and how soft it makes my dry skin feel. Id love to repurchase if I could get it to not sting sometimes!Im about to buy my second bottle of this stuff. Its absolutely saved my skin. My skin is insanely soft my pores have gotten smaller the fine lines I was noticing around my mouth have vanished and its doing wonders for the crepe like skin starting to show on my neck. This the only moisturizer Ive ever used that lasts all day and doesnt make me break or make me oily on my combination skin. It smells wonderful as well! This cream I will keep on hand!Im about to buy my second bottle of this amazing stuff. Its absolutely saved my skin. My skin is insanely soft my pores have gotten smaller the fine lines I was noticing around my mouth have vanished and its doing wonders for the crepe like skin starting to show on my neck. This is the only moisturizer Ive ever used that lasts all day and doesnt make me break or make it to oily on my combination skin. It smells wonderful as well! This product will always be on hand!
4555070000000,I don�t want to speak too soon (its only been 5 days) but I love this product so far!  been having a lot of hormonal breakouts due to medication I am on and have been searching for something that can soothe all the redness that results. This has been great so far. Notice less inflammation already.I first got this as a sample and I couldn�t tell if it was working with such a small size. So I purchased a full size back in February and It has been wonderful. It now takes the place of my cream moisturizer and it helps reduce the redness and irritation I have after wearing my mask at work for hours. its also helped reduce the number of intense breakouts. So Yay!!! I�ll probably be buying this for the next four years.I go though moisturizers really quickly so I was looking for a nice sized and decently priced one. I really like this one. It has a thicker consistency but it still sits under my makeup just fine.Doesn�t irritate my sensitive skin and is ultra moisturizing without causing oiliness. Love.I don�t have acne per se I do have occasional breakouts and uneven texture. I got this with one of my rewards and dIsn�t know what to expect. I LOVE it. I put on as my last step and though it looks like a thick ointment cream type when it comes out of the tube it melts into my skin. It also mattifies my skin and not greasy at all. Definitely on the repurchase list!!
4565740000000,This is my all time favorite serum! I swear by this if I don�t put it on after my wash before bed I feel like Im missing something. I have to have this at all times. It makes your face feel baby soft. It definitely helps with any marks you have.So far so good!! This has definitely brightened my face and it makes my skin feel so smooth. Ill definitely keep repurchasing this serum .This serum is super brightening and comfortable. Also cant complain about the price.I have sensitive skin and can not use this daily or it starts irritating my skin BUT using it once or twice a week has great brightening and smoothing effects!!I started using this serum around two months ago to help manage my rosacea. While using it I had no major flare ups. I couldnt tell if this was due to the serum or other products so I stopped using it to see how effective it was. When I stopped using it for a week I had an intense flare up with some pustules. When I started using this serum again everything calmed down. Needless to say this is a holy grail staple product for me! I love that it has two different forms of licorice root niacinamide AND is totally fragrance free/essential oil free. Ive used this with other hydrating serums and it worked great but now I prefer using it on its own to really let the ingredients do their thing. Ive used it morning and night when my skin is feeling a little more sensitive. When its more under control I just use it in the morning and other serums at night. Either way has been really effective for my sensitive skin.
4567340000000,Im a big fan. The pads are so light and full of product but not overly full where it runs down your face. There is enough to do your neck and chest should you choose. You can feel your skin slightly tighten when it dries but not too tight.Im really enjoying these toner pads. Ive got some dark pigmentation spots on my cheeks and the vitamin c is helping to lighten them up. I have been using them in the morning and at night and I havent had any issues with my sensitive skin.A really good sheet mask my skin looks brighter afterI have been enjoying this serum. Im also using the toner pads from this line and my dark spots on my cheeks have lightened up. I have sensitive skin and its hard to find vitamin c products that don�t cause irritation.I have noticed that my skin has been more supple and many of my scars have faded from previous acne. I bought this on a whim but Im glad I did. I Cant wait to see how my skin improves as the weather warms up.
4567350000000,Very calming and soothing.This mask calmed my skin but also very hydrating.These are great at reducing redness. I like to use after running outside. Very cold and calming.Feels almost like a jelly mask and comes on a backing which makes it easy to open. Fits my face really well. I recommend keeping it in the fridge for extra soothing and cooling properties. Im on an oral retinoid daily (Acitretin) and my oily skin is really dehydrated and red in spots and this mask helped calm the inflammation and re-hydrate my skin without feeling greasy.I love this mask so much. The serum is light and calming and it makes my skin feel plump and hydrated. There�s extra serum to rub into my neck/chest and it has a faint herbal smell (nothing chemical or artificial though). I put one in the fridge once so I could use it before I put makeup on and it was so soothing. My skin was smooth and even and my makeup looked amazing. 10/10 would recommend.
4567370000000,Im so glad that I received this free gift in one of my orders. This product is so underrated I absolutely love it and works great with my very picky and sensitive skin. I will definitely keep repurchasing this product. I love the way it sits on my face no white cast if you rub it in long enough. Im usually not fond of overly fragrant skin care but this one has a pleasant one that I don�t mind. I love the healthy glow it gives my skin whenever I apply it. No irritation redness or breakouts when I use this. Try it! You won�t regret itWorks well for my super-sensitive reactive skin. It feels light and breathable. There is no stinging or itching even near the eyes. Ive had no breakouts. There is a bit of a white cast. Very pleased with this product and plan to continue using.tried this before and purchased it again. Very moisturizingNot greasy full absorb. In LoveI like this sunscreen because it doesnt leave my face feeling oily. It does have a white color but I have lighter tan skin and the sunscreen blends in well. The formula itself is more like liquid than a cream. I put this product on after applying my moisturizer.
4568690000000,combination/oily skin Ive had a good routine recently (double cleanse/toner/serum/moisturizer/sunscreen) that helped calm my breakouts so I thought Id finally give this a try. I had high expectations from this but I wanted to keep my skincare to a minimum (cleanser/this essence on palm and patted/ moisturizer) when I used this to make sure it didnt had any bad reaction to the other products I was using. Unfortunately later that day despite keeping my skincare minimal I had little bumps on my chin and a portion of my cheek as a result. I was careful not to mix it with any other active acids too and made sure I used a light moisturizer given the warmer weather but alas. About half a year ago my face had a bad reaction to something else so I was happy that my recent routine helped soothe and calm my skin and yet here I am again 😞Hi there  Im so sorry to hear that this product didnt work out for you. Our team is happy to provide assistance. Please reach out to hellosokoglam.com about this product along with your order number. Thanks! )This is one of like three reviews Ive ever written in my life. I got the Soko Glam advent calendar and this stuff was in there and it has CHANGED ME. I didnt expect it to do anything and didnt pay attention to what it promises (since I had the bottle I was gonna use it anyway). My skin looks UNREAL like a full-on snapchat filter or something. Im nearly 40 and I cant believe how smooth and plump my face looks. I normally keep my product spending at $20 max per item but Im more than willing to drop twice that for this stuff.I have already purchased my second kombucha essence. It really works.Ive been using this product for about 2 months now and havent really noticed the benefits it claims. Fast absorbing. it does have a gentle light smell. This product is not worth the price. I will not be repurchasing this product.
4575620000000,Not a powerhouse product but great to calm skin and nourish great with sensitive or irritated skin.a hydrating dream! i enjoy using this serum on nights im not using retinol. its very soothing & feels nice on my skin.Okay first I have extremely oily skin but its been feeling kind of dull and looking dry in some spots. My husband bought this for me after seeing me researching it and I love it.  been using it for about a week now in the mornings and its great. I use half pump after toner and it makes my skin feel moisturized and healthy. I still need to use blotting papers throughout the day to get rid of excess oil but when I do my skin still has the fresh healthy glow. That wasn�t the case before using this so Im very impressed. Highly recommend.This product completely changed the texture of my skin for the better! If you have combo skin and you are looking for a product to treat both acne and dehydration - this is it!! My breakouts are almost completely gone. I only wish it was bigger because I use it up so quickly.Works wonderfully for my dry dehydrated skin I just wish it lasted longer/ came in a larger size
4605580000000,I just started double cleansing for the first time this year and this was the first oil cleanser  tried FYI I don�t wear makeup it has improved my skin texture and leaves me feeling smooth and clean.The pads feels so good on the skin. It really does give me a squeeky good clean!purchased this item not too long and it removes ALL OF MY MAKEUP! Not harsh on my oily skin.As the title says it is great removing oil but something in the formula made my eyes itch and burn for about an hour after application. I tried it again once with the same issue before I just gave it away but I don�t know if they dealt with the same issue.Hi K  Im very sorry to hear that you may have a sensitivity to an ingredient in this product. Our team is happy to help! Please send us an email at hellosokoglam.com about the product including your order number. Thank you! )
4616700000000,I was hesitant to try the double cleanse since my skin does not tolerate most oils in products very well. But I was intrigued by this version with AHA/BHA so I decided to give it a try. I am so happy with the results!! My skin feels more balanced in terms of hydration/oil production and I think my pores are less visible - they are definitely clearer! As part of a double cleanse this product does the job of cleaning fully without dehydrating my skin. As an added bonus it feels so luxurious massaging the balm into my skin I really look forward to my skincare routine )I used this during a funny winter/spring in humid Georgia! Combined with a good moisturizer at night it really helped some breakouts along my mask lines!I love the clean color of the packaging smell of the cleamer and provided scoop! It does seem to unclog some pores that are exuding their own oils and seemingly works well in a two step cleaning routine. So far so good.I really like it. Its even better than the previous versions and makes my skin feel smootherI think this is great just like the original version (the pink container). If you dont like scented skincare products I do think this one is scented unlike the other version. I think it works great just like the others. Although I think I prefer the original version better just out of preference. Nothing bad to say about it! ^^
4620180000000,Ive been using it for a good two months and its definitely moisturizing. I have more oily acne-prone than dry combination skin. I didnt really see my breakouts go away in fact they mightve gotten a little worse. I think this would be good for drier skin types tbh.I really really wanted to like this product especially since it is my first intro for essences and it was recommended to me by the Skin Concierge. Unfortunately I was disappointed ( it worked well the first couple of times it soothed breakouts sped up healing and noticeably reduced early signs of aging. After that it just leaves a sticky film on the skin and any product after it pills and doesnt sink in so the skin looks shiny and uneven. I tried using smaller and smaller amountsboth with my fingers and with a cotton pad but it didnt change the outcome. I think this is best for people with a damaged skin barrier after-sun care sensitivity or any other problematic issue. I would NOT recommend it for chronic use.Hi Sarah   Thank you for your feedback. We understand that skincare is all about trial and error and Im so sorry to hear that this product stopped working for you! Please know that our team is always available to provide alternative recommendations that are suitable to your skin type & concerns.So I was using CosRX snail essence (which my skin LOVED) but Soko Glam has been out of it for awhile...after using the mask version of this and Ive really enjoyed it! I wish I could figure out how to DIY my own masks with this because I definitely notice a difference when using the mask vs this (which is pretty watery & if youve used snail mucus you know its thicker). But the fragrance in here doesnt really bother me (and Im normally super sensitive to scents and get headaches from it. )My skin absolutely loves this! Soaks in quickly and no reaction whatsoever. It is very soothing. Adds just a tiny bump in moisture as well.
4620200000000,I use this cleaner as the second step in the double cleanse followed by the Acwell Watery Cleansing Oil as the first step. I like the way these make my skin feel — clean but not stripped of moisture but also not oily or greasy. For this one in particular a small amount goes a really long way. I would recommend them both!Used to replace my normal cleanser which has PHA while I adjust to retinol. Very clean no noticeable scent applies and rinses easy with no residue and leaves face clean but not dry or stripped. Extremely gentle product.I got a sample size of this during a promotion.. now I want a full size! its so nice and gentle yet my skin feels so clean. I love how its unscented and the blue bottle is so pretty!I just used this cleanser for the first time as my second cleanse after the accompanying watery oil cleanser and I am wondering if my skin has ever truly been clean before. After rinsing and waiting for my face to dry my skin felt just like...skin. It felt clean and plump and moisturized and smooth and healthy the way it should feel. I am in awe. For reference I have combination-to-dry acne-prone skin with a fair amount of texture. I have used gel cleansers before but this one has a unique and pleasant texture. I Cant wait to see the results after a few weeks!Tried this out after using TIMY�s cleansing balm and it was lovely. Wonderful clean feel and love knowing it has a pH of 5.5
4620640000000,Absolutely love this! Does exactly what it says on the bottle and all in a perfect fine mist.highly recommend this product!Using every day morning and night for hydration and toning. Has replaced my old toner but I also add an essence after this. So far no breakouts and skin is responding well!I had the essence and saw they made it into a mist. Both pretty good.I had been using the Neogen Real Ferment Essence for many months and I was OBSESSED. It gave my skin just the softest feel and my skin never felt tacky at all. When I saw this new micro mist I knew I had to try it.   Unfortunately I dont really think its as good compared to the original product. It leaves more of a sticky feeling on your skin-- not sure if its because of the hyaluronic acid or not. I also really doubt it has a high enough concentration of vitamin C to make a difference in my skin. The fact that its in a clear bottle makes me suspicious that vitamin C is really an active ingredient in this mist.  However it hasnt made me break out at all which is impressive because my skin is SUPER sensitive. But overall Id say to purchase the original Neogen essence over this one.
4620650000000,Pretty decent hydrator that didn�t irritate. I expected it to calm my skin instantly but that wasn�t the case. A little while after putting this on my slightly irritated skin my face did look a little less red though... Not sure if I�ll buy it again but I�ll probably keep hunting for that magic HG silicone free instantly calming essence/toner that plays well with vitamin c and retinol.This essence is so soothing and hydrating. It soaks right in and it seems to help my serums do the same. It reminds me so much of artemisia essence but easier on the pocket book. If you like mugwort I believe you will like this too.This essence has done wonders for the redness I sometimes get around my cheeks and nose area. I couldn�t be happier with it!I have sensitive (redness products tend to sting/burn) combination skin with a super-oily T-zone. PROS unscented cooling smooth silicone-like finish (in a good way) long-lasting moisture doesnt exacerbate oily areas CONS None for meI had been looking for something to hydrate and soothe my skin since I am prone to redness in some spots. I pat this onto my face at night before moisturizer or a sleep mask and I havent had any reactions to it! There is barely any scent so I would recommend this if youre usually sensitive to fragrance.
4634660000000,Nice lightweight serum! Love the metal applicator on this is cooling to the skin around the eye and slightly massages.this smells amazing and feels nice on my skin. it irritates my eyes when i put it to close to them tho. and i dont know how much it reduces wrinkles. sensitive normal skin kinda dry
4634770000000,My skin was feeling really dry and like I couldn�t exfoliate enough after they discontinued (?) the enature marshmallow foam cleanser and I couldn�t find anything that worked for me (Neogen pink tube skin food egg foam clean it zero foam). Tried this one on a whim with no reviews and its a winner!! My skin is so smooth and my fine lines between my eyebrows and my smile lines are pretty much non-existent. Even my under eyes look better! AND  been cheating and using only the zero balm this and the pink SkinRx cream. I too was put off by the “acne formula” sticker because I don�t have acne but I guess its just because it has BHA (salicylic acid) in it. About to buy some backup tubes because I Cant live without this now.Like the other reviewer I was also surprised they added on the “acne” formula sticker. I didn�t notice it had salicylic acid when I purchased it or I would have skipped it as I use other ingredients from my dermatologist. However it was already here and I didn�t want to waste it so I decided to use it on my back instead to keep it extra clean after washing my long hair. It foams nicely smell isn�t too overpowering and it has kept my skin clean. Since the sticker was added I�d probably add that to your photos.I was a little confused when it arrived because there was a sticker on the container that said “acne formula” which is not what I wanted. So I went back to the site and nowhere did it indicate that this was meant to clear up acne. Nevertheless I gave it a try. I really like this cleanser. It has a light mint scent and a nice sturdy foam. After I use it my skin feels very clean and well prepared for the next steps.
4640220000000,I absolutely love this sleeping mask. It melts onto the skin and feels heavenly with a nice citrus scent. I always wake up with my skin feeling wonderful. My skin tone seems more even and is definitely more suppleYooooo Im so glad I tried this! My face is so bright and healthy-looking in the morning and while its sticky its not clogging up my pores especially on my neck where my skin is more sensitive. 10/10 will order again!I am delighted that I opted to try this mask. My skin has never been so silky and bright! My acne scars are slowly but surely clearing up. I use this in conjunction with another Soko Glam vitamin E moisturizer and the results are undeniable.Made my skin SUPER SOFT in the morning! I havent really noticed any skin brightness but my skin is loving it!My only complaint is that I wish it was a little thicker since it is a face mask. It smells pleasant and makes my skin glow. I love that it has retinol in it. Benefits galore! Wish it came in a larger jar!
4640230000000,This product is meant to be used as a first cleanser. I was confused because I thought you can use it as a second cleanser and honestly you can - but it works great at a first cleanser since its oil-based. I love how easy this is to use. With normal oil cleansers you need to emulsify the oil and rinse it off. With this you just wash your face and there�s no need to emulsify because the product is already milky! It cleans well and gets off everything. Also my skin feels soft afterwards and not dry at all. Minimal scent and good cleansing power.
4647150000000,I like the texture of the night cream as it is more on the gel based texture type. It is also very hydrating. However Im not sure if I want to buy it again.GreatI love this night cream so much! It has a really smooth and cooling gel texture and a lavendar scent thats not overpowering. I normally hate scented products but this is mild and feels calming. I highly recommend!I only need about two dime sized dabs to cover my entire face. Feels immediately hydrating on contact and absorbs very quickly. My skin feels so smooth in the morning.My problem with the creams Ive been using at night is that as moist and hydrated as my skin felt after applying them by the morning my skin felt like a parched desert again. This new cream from my favorite K-beauty maker Neogen has me & my skin now waking up in the morning still feeling hydrated. Thats five star material as far as Im concerned!
4647870000000,I have sensitive acne prone skin. This cleanser is gentle and non-drying. I like how easy it is to wash the product off with water which helps if your in a rush in the morning.I really wanted to love this cleanser because the texture is amazing. However I noticed that I started developing milia around my eye area and upper cheeks after using this product. I stopped using the cleanser and the milia went away. I dont recommend this for anyone who is prone to getting milia.Absolutely love this! Soothing and cleansing perfect for refreshing skin in the morning. Doesnt leave any tightness feels fresh and revitalizing.I have sensitive (redness products tend to sting/burn) combination skin with a super-oily T-zone. PROS Love this stuff! leaves my skin smooth and clean pleasant scent (slightly herbal) mild but effective exfoliation dont need to use a lot CONS None for meI bought this cleanser because I started using a retinoid at night for acne a few months ago so I wanted to add something gentle and hydrating with BHA to my morning routine. This checks all of the boxes! I love the AHA/BHA/PHA combo which leaves my skin soft and luminous without feeling stripped or tight. Ive noticed that my acne seems less inflamed and comes to the surface more quickly (though I am also using a retinoid so Id think of this cleanser as more of a boost).  I love the very slight fragrance and the texture is nice. Its a gel that melts into liquid so I dab it on to damp skin and then gently rub in with my fingers. This cleanser probably wouldnt be hefty enough to remove makeup or sunscreen at the end of the day but is perfect for the morning when I want to wake up refreshed.
4649980000000,Love this! Very hydrating and brightening. I love the way it feels on my skin. It has a nice hydrating slip feeling that sits great over toner and under serums.Really enjoying this essence. Theres a slightly sticky texture that feels protective and pleasant. Its a rich product almost like a serum in itself. Seeing a reduction in dryness redness and discoloration.I totally thought this was going to be too watery and more like a toner. So wrong about that it is the perfect consistency! It is so hydrating but without the slimy feeling. For me this beats the Hanskin essence. I highly suggest this for the amazing ginseng niacinamide price and packaging!This is gentle on my skin and I love the way it feels. It had a light and pleasant scent.been wanting to try this out and finally got my hands on it when sokoglam had it. All i have to say is ...my pores look smaller because of how hydrated my skin looks and feels. beauty of joseon never disappoints.
4650080000000,Gives you a glow without looking greasy.Smells really good and has a good effect on my skin texture!This is thin and glides on smoothly with no irritation or tacky film. It absorbs quickly and its easy to layer with other products. Relieves redness and does a great job brightening up my completion and evening out skin tone.I only used this product for few days so I can only tell what difference it made to my skin in these days. My skin felt hydrated nourished and bright after use. I use it with toner and moisture that also has similar ingredients. It worked for me.only been using for a couple weeks but no bad reaction and its working well with my other C!
4652280000000,I bought this for my mother so the skin type and age range listed is for her. I got it for her to replace a carrot spray she used to use all the time before it was discontinued about 6 years ago. She has been missing it since then but when she got this she absolutely loved it! She says that it is very refreshing no stickiness and doesnt ruin any makeup if you use it as a refreshing mist during the day. She loves it more than her old formula! It gets used daily and she feels that her skin is always glowing with this!I have dry/dehydrated skin thats prone to break outs. I needed a little extra umfph in my routine and this was it! So good it didnt break me out and integrated well with my ultimate snail bee serum from benton as well as my other serums from son by mi and beauty of joseon and iunik. My boyfriend even started using and saw a reduction in pore size and his crows feet smooth out. Its his go to so we have to stock up. Im so excited sokoglam finally curated this item!!
4666080000000,I really like the consistency of this cream and how it feels on my under eyes. Very moisturizing.Super nice packaging great product. I like that its like a balm so you don�t accidentally use too much productI love this eye cream! I typically don�t like to wear eye cream during the day time bc i don�t like how many of them melt off my eye makeup. This one gives just the right amount of moisture and does not melt off my eye makeup! its brightening smells wonderful.Reduced appearance of darkness under eyes and wrinkles at corners. Didn�t come with a spoon to dip product out.
4669760000000,This makes my skin smooth and soft and is lightweight and absorbs quickly.Love the silky texture. Its very lightweight but hydrating and leaves skin feeling soft. There is also no detectable fragrance (big win) and it comes with cute little stickers inside the box!Ive been trying to find a moisturizer that would not dry out my skin for months. Especially while wearing a mask. This product does much better than lots of others I have tried. Thank youHYRAM made me buy it and Im on my second bottle!!! I love this product please don�t ever get rid of it!!!   Super light weight feel to it and sinks fast into the skin. I use this product during the day non sticky and doesn�t have a smell to it. Wonderful moisturizer! Going to buy for my family and friends as gifts soon!!Its a nice moisturizer I personally will use it when it gets cold outside again since I have oily skin.
6535900000000,This is one of the best moisturizers Ive ever used - and Ive used TONS! Its thick and creamy but goes on smoothly and doesnt feel heavy on your skin. My skin is dry and sensitive so this is the perfect moisturizer for anyone looking for something non-irritating and truly moisturizing! I was truly shocked that I got such an amazing moisturizer at this price point and will definitely be repurchasing time and time again!I use this as my night time moisturizer and it hydrates my skin wonderfully. Its not really thick and Id say its actually a bit lightweight but still very moisturizing. It absorbs easily and a little bit goes a long way.I have extremely dry skin and this one really nourishes my face just like their amazing sheet masks. I love their masks and hoped that this moisturizer would be just as moisturizing and it was! The scent was a light ocean-y fragrance and after waking up my face still felt very hydrated!After using this my skin has that extra bounce I get when I use the hydration sheet mask. I love it!I love using this when my skin needs more moisture in it and the best part is that Im not a greaseball around my T-Zone when I wake up in the morning after using this!
