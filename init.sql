Both the leaves and brewed tea tend to have a dark color, although some black teas are golden or greenish in color. In Chinese, black tea is called hóngchá(紅茶), meaning red tea, although in English, red tea more often refers to rooibos, an herbal tea that is not made from the tea plant. Black tea also tends to contain more tannins, chemicals giving the tea its characteristic dark color. The tannins are actually a form of antioxidants, and are the chemicals that the catechins of green tea are transformed to when they undergo oxidation. Black tea is the most popular and widespread type of tea in the world, and makes up the bulk of the world''s tea production and consumption; outside of southeast Asia, an overwhelming majority of the tea produced and consumed is black tea. In many cultures, when people say tea, they are referring to black tea. Black tea is grown in many countries and comes in many styles and grades; it is hard to generalize about the flavor or aroma of black teas. Black tea is the only type of tea that is widely classified into grades of tea using a system of letters, like OP, FTGFOP, BOP, etc. It is a widespread assumption that black teas are stronger, more bitter, and more heavily caffeinated than green teas; this is not true: green teas can be quite bitter, and black teas can be mellow. The strength of tea depends both on how it is brewed and the style and grade of tea used. The caffeine content also varies greatly from one tea to the next and depends on how the tea is brewed--and it is not safe to assume that black tea contains more caffeine than green or other types of tea. In general, black teas with more tips / leaf buds such as golden monkey are the most heavily-caffeinated of black teas, and souchongs, made out of larger leaves, are less caffeinated. Black teas used in English Breakfast and Irish Breakfast blends are usually deliberately chosen for their moderate-to-high caffeine content. Brewing tea is a complex art and is also a matter of peronal taste. In general, black teas tend to taste best when brewed with boiling water. A rare exception to this rule are a few of the lightest black teas, like some Darjeeling first flush, a few of which produce better results when brewed with water slightly below the boiling point. The optimal steeping times of black teas vary widely; strong, broken-leaf black teas infuse quickly and often taste best with brief steeping times, sometimes only about 1 minute, whereas other teas may taste best if steeped as long as 5-8 minutes. Black tea typically stays fresh and retains its flavor longer than green or white teas. A typical black tea, properly stored in a dark, airtight container, can be stored for 2 years or more with little difference in flavor. Some more delicate black teas, however, like Darjeeling first flush, do not always store as well. See our article on storing tea for more info.',79.6,'Spring 2022. "Classic" Yunnan aroma. mild, nothing distinctive. Liquor (5 min steep, using the Breville tea machine) is a nice brown with a slight gold tinge. Tasty, great for sipping. PS: The leaves are long. I might have used less tea than actually needed for a full 6 cup pot. Next pot I will crush the leaves into smaller pieces for a more accurate measuring.','Solid Assam, good aroma with the expected earthiness, maybe a slight of chocolate. The liquor (5 min steep) is a dark brown. A nice ''clear'' Assam taste, with absolutely no after taste.','Nice aroma, with a mild earthy scent. The liquor (5 min steep) is a dark brown. Good flavor, easy to sip all day long. Nice blend.','Classic Yunnan aroma with a solid earthiness and a hint of spice. The liquor (5 min steep) is a medium amber brown. Good taste, with a subtle hint of spice. This is a great tea for an all sipping experience.','I tried this tea right when I ordered it, but did not like it. It had few objectionable qualities, and was actually quite smooth, but simply seemed a little boring. However, I set it in my cupboard for quite some time and sure enough, it has started tasting more interesting after about a year and a half. Still, it is not my favorite and I thought it was expensive relative to how much I enjoyed it. The dry leaf has a rather different aroma from most of the Yunnan red teas I''ve tried. The smell reminds me a lot of the larger-leaf Assam teas I ordered from TeaOrb a while back. There is more of a fermented (and I mean fermented, not oxidized) smell, a sort of smell reminiscent of decaying autumn leaves, with some deep fruity and herbaceous notes. The brewed cup is very interesting. The flavor is exceptionally smooth, in my opinion, too much so. I prefer teas to have a bit more body. However the smoothness allows you to brew this tea more strongly, to bring out more complexity in the flavor. The flavor is quite sweet, and lightly savory/umami, but there is little bitterness or sourness. At times the cup reminds me of some Japanese green teas, flavor-wise. The aroma has a lot going on, but is subtle. Fleeting notes appear, vanish, then reappear. Notes include a nice floral honey, autumn leaves (less than from the smell of the dry leaf), and fruitiness but it''s hard to pin down on a specific fruit. The fruitiness of the brewed cup is more like fresh fruit, contrasting with the dry leaf which suggested dried fruit. One thing that was interesting to me about aging is that I found after letting this tea sit for about a year and a half, the floral notes seemed stronger, which surprised me, as those notes are often not the type that stick around in a tea''s aroma as you age it. The tea resteeps well. Some aromatic notes come out in the resteeps that were not present initially, such as cinnamon notes or notes of wood, faintly smoky. Some of the subsequent steeps can have a more oolong-like character. However I think it may be exaggerating to say this can be steeped 8+ times gong fu style. Perhaps this tea just wasn''t suited for my tastes, but I found because it was too smooth and lacked the bitterness that I often seek out in tea, I found it gave out much earlier than that. But I also thought that all steeps were somehow unsatisfying to me, no matter how I brewed it. This tea was interesting, and I can recognize that quality craftsmanship went into its production, but in the end I did not enjoy it as much as the robust Yunnan teas. Some of them had at least as much aromatic complexity, but more body and flavour. I also thought it was quite pricey. Some of my favorite teas from Yunnan Sourcing cost little more than half as much as this one, yet I enjoy them much more. So, for someone with my taste, I thought this was overpriced. Someone who likes very smooth, sweet, mellow teas and dislikes bitterness and astrigency might enjoy this one more.','Health & Tea','Murchie''s Tea & Coffee Ltd','Mark T.

Although the region produces a small number of green teas, Assam green teas are very uncommon; when a tea is referred to as "Assam" it invariably means black tea. Assam is further identified by means of production into CTC (Crush, Tear, Curl, a mechanical process) and orthodox (traditionally produced) tea. CTC tea is cheaper and infuses faster, whereas orthodox tea tends to be more expensive, more complex, and require longer brewing times. Assam is produced from a large-leafed variety of the tea plant, Camellia sinensis assamica, a different variety from both Chinese teas and teas in the Darjeeling district of India. This variety, although associated with Assam, is sometimes grown in other regions. Assam teas have a unique flavor both due to the low altitude of the Assam region and the special variety of tea plant used. The aroma of Assam teas is often described as malty. Most Assam teas are described as strong and powerful; Assam is one of the most common ingredients in breakfast blends and strong black tea blends, particularly Irish Breakfast and Ostfriesen tea. However, Assam teas are diverse and there are smoother and subtler black teas produced in this region as well.',79,'Solid Assam, good aroma with the expected earthiness, maybe a slight of chocolate. The liquor (5 min steep) is a dark brown. A nice ''clear'' Assam taste, with absolutely no after taste.','Really nice cup of tea! It was thick bodied and the flavor was rich and sweet. I didn’t notice much of an aroma however, but I could be having sinus issues now. I’ll come back and update my review if I notice more of an aroma later! But either way it still is a rly nice tea!','Aroma is not too strong but it does smell nice and interesting too! It actually has notes of raspberry in the aroma and taste and it’s rly unique and good! Otherwise it just tastes like a very classic assam tea, there is no objectionable astringentness or bitterness.','This was a rather strong, but high-quality Assam sold for an exceptionally good price. The dry leaf has a potent aroma, spicy and fruity. I already notice the raspberry notes even in the dry leaf. But the aroma somehow betrays a slight harshness: I can tell this is going to be a tea with a bit of an edge, even before I brew it. The brewed cup is exactly what I expect from the aroma: bold, strong, sharp flavor, moderately tannic and also bitter, with an undertone of savory, sour, and slightly sweet flavors. Thick and satisfying, but can be a bit much, depending on the mood you''re in. If you want one of those kick-you-in-the-face breakfast teas this would be a good candidate. One thing I liked about this though, with respect to flavor and mouthfeel, is that the harshness is more up-front, and the finish is smoother and sweeter, and the lingering sensations on the palate are pleasing. The aroma of the brewed cup is fairly typical for an Assam, malty and fruity and slightly floral, but, just like the description, there are distinct notes of raspberry in there. I like it. I could see this tea pairing well with scones for this reason, creating somewhat of a "raspberry jam" vibe even with plain scones. This tea resteeps fairly well and retains a similar character in the second steep. Interestingly though, I found that the first steep tasted better as it cooled, whereas the resteep was really only good when still hot, and tasted unpleasantly harsh and not as satisfying when it had cooled. I recommend going a bit easy on the leaf, if brewed too strongly this tea can get a little overwhelming. I don''t drink tea with milk but this one might be a good candidate for adding milk to. The price is very good.$8.80 for 4 ounces, you rarely see a tea of this grade and quality for this price. I highly recommend this. Yes, it''s not my favorite Assam I ordered from S&V, but it''s A LOT cheaper and still very enjoyable. If you''re looking for a bargain buy this is a great option, especially if you like the stronger, bolder Assams.','The aroma of this tea is wonderful and bready and the aroma doesn’t wear off as you drink it. The taste is very smooth and honestly very “normal.” I like this tea because it is not astringent and it makes me feel good after drinking it (some teas don’t fully agree with me). For how normal this tea is though, it is a bit expensive so that’s why the value is a bit lower for me. There are so many other cheap teas that are just this good in my opinion. There are no flavorful notes that stick out to me which is why I rated the flavor lower.','Arbor Teas','Taylors of Harrogate','Ahmad Tea','Two Leaves and a Bud','Hampstead Tea');

Normally, "gunpowder tea" refers to gunpowder green tea. The black style of tea is less common. Unlike its green cousin, it does not have a smoky aroma. The only thing that the two teas have in common is that they tend to be produced in China and that they are rolled into a similar shape. Many oolongs are also rolled into a similar shape, but these teas are usually not referred to as "gunpowder", in part because their colors tend to range through greens and deep browns.',57,'The dry leaves are a lovely dull brown colour.

Darjeeling black tea is often categorized by flush, the time of year at which the tea leaves are harvested. Darjeeling tea is produced by different tea gardens, and the higher-quality teas from this region are often sold as single-estate teas, marked as originating from a particular estate. Darjeeling tends to be lighter than other black teas, although teas from this region are diverse. For this reason, Darjeeling is often a favorite for afternoon tea, either on its own, or as an ingredient in lighter afternoon blends, in British tea culture. Some Darjeelings have an aroma that resembles muscatel grapes, a variety of grape sometimes used for wine. These Darjeelings share this quality with some bai hao oolong, a Chinese oolong tea that also often resembles muscatel grapes. Unlike most black teas, Darjeeling teas often have a substantial portion of greener (less oxidized) leaves mixed in, which gives the dry leaves a diversity of colors. In some cases, such as with some high-grown first flush Darjeelings, the leaf is entirely green in color. Brewed Darjeeling tea has a wide range of color; many Darjeelings are an amber color, lighter in hue than most other black teas. Some Darjeelings, especially the highly-desired first flush teas, are less oxidized and are more like oolongs than black teas, although these teas are distinct from proper Darjeeling oolongs. Other regions of India, such as Sikkim, and nearby regions outside of India, such as Nepal, produce teas in a similar style to Darjeeling tea. Teas from these regions are not referred to as Darjeeling, but are often categorized by the same system of flushes. These areas together form the Himalayan region of tea production.',60.8,'Part of Upton''s Great Tea Race Collection, this Darjeeling crosses the finish line with a fine aroma and impressive flavor. There are notes of caramel, fresh leaves, and mild tannins. It is very expensive however - it costs 3 times the price of an ordinary Darjeeling, but does not offer 3 times the quality imo. Nice with lemon and sugar.','Half-litre pot at home, made from a sample included in the tea company''s Advent Tea Calendar (2020) and consisting of fine Darjeeling leaves in all shades of green and some brown ones, too. Pours clear lightish amber (against white china) with no sediment. Clear aroma of Darjeeling tea leaves, leafy and a little malty. Ditto flavour. Mildly astringent palate with a leafy aftertaste. A very nice Darjeeling. I normally prefer stronger teas, such as Assam or Ceylon, but this one is rather good. I might consider buying a regular portion one day. Definitely a reasonable price, given the context (ca. €0.42 per 1 sample in the collection; regular portions are expensive, reaching €12.70 per 100 g). 7 4 5 80 12 g / l; 100 C; 2 min. Review #150','Half-litre cup at home, made from fine small green, brown and yellow leaves. Pours clear peach yellow (against white china) with no sediment. Very mild aroma of fresh leaves, much faintier than the loose leaves themselves emit. Mild, leafy but fresh and pure flavour of black tea, with floral touches. A delicate palate, turning gradually more and more astringent, with a leafy aftertaste, but very far away in its intensity from the more pronounced and heavier sorts like Ceylon and Assam. A very delicate and enjoyable drink. Not exactly cheap but still within the limits of affordability (€7.95 per 100 g). This is my first Darjeeling review, and I would definitely like to write some more. 8 4 3 85 12 g / l; 100 C; 2 min. Review #106','I suspected something was wrong with the quality (or lack thereof) of this tea when I opened up the tin and there was no scent. (Side note: The best by date isn''t for about 2 years, so that''s not the issue.) Some teas have a very, very light scent, though. So, I tried to suspend judgment and brewed a cup as the packaging specified. The water did turn color, lightly, so clearly the tea did infuse. But, there wasn''t much of any taste. Sometimes, teas have a different (even stronger) taste when you leave them to cool. That wasn''t hard to do, because drinking what tastes like hot water is not appealing to me. Yet, when it cooled a bit, there was still virtually no taste. As if this weren''t bad enough, the tea (if you can even give it that label) made me jittery -- really, really jittery. It was as if everything were somehow sucked out of this tea, except for an insane amount of hand-shaking, spine-trembling caffeine. (An unusual reaction for me to have to any tea, let alone a black tea, which typically gives me an alert calmness.) I''d had Darjeeling from Twinings and it did have a taste (it also didn''t give me that strange jittery reaction). So, I suspected something was seriously wrong. I looked up articles and tried brewing the tea with a different recipe (i.e. amount of tea, temperature, duration, etc.). But, it still turned out basically the same. Just to make sure I gave this tea every possible chance I could, I contacted the company. They were courteous, but they weren''t any help at all. I really tried to make this work, and I can only think of one other finicky tea that I''ve had in my life that I may have brewed more times and given more chances than this. But, it was all to no avail. Insofar as tea is an ideally fragrant dried leaf which produces an ideally fragrant and tasty beverage when infused in water, this fails to even qualify as tea. If you like tea that has no scent and no taste, I have good news for you! This is actually called "hot water" and can be gotten without the need for spending $12.50 on a tin. Simply bring water to a boil in a kettle, then pour out into a mug and add honey and/or lemon to taste. Then, you can save that $12.50 for a rainy day or give it to charity. This also saves you the indecency of kicking yourself, for having spent $12.50 on tea which actually isn''t tea in any meaningful sense of the word.','The dry tea is chopped up quite fine. It looks like a typical Darjeeling, having a range of colors from light green to a dark brown, indicating a range of oxidations. Taylor''s puts 2.5 grams of tea in their bags, splitting the difference between the typical American 2 grams and the 3 grams of many English bagged teas. Both the dry and steeping tea include the green vegetal aromas that are typical of late flush Darjeelings, like asparagus and string beans. As the other reviewers found, the first taste is shockingly bitter, though. It''s not quite as bitter as an Assam, but it''s more bitter than most Sri Lankan teas and definitely uncharacteristic of a Darjeeling. The flavor''s reasonably strong, but I do use 8 ounces of water per teabag, in line with Alex''s comment. There''s a woody component to the flavor, along with a bit of straw. The overall impression is of a farm without animals: oak leaves, vegetables, and a clean barn with bales of hay and straw. For what it''s worth, I like it, but it''s not particularly special. Between $4 and $5 for 20 bags, it''s only slightly more expensive than Bigelow or Twinings when accounting for the larger teabags, and of comparable quality.','Teavana','Ahmad Tea','Hampstead Tea','Arbor Teas','Happy Earth Tea');

Although technically classified as a black tea, first flush Darjeeling tea has often a lighter, often greenish color and can be much milder than most black teas. Many first flush Darjeeling teas are low in bitterness, but relatively high in astringency, and can have considerable natural sweetness. They often have a pronounced floral aroma as well, and some have a "muscatel" aroma, suggesting muscat grapes. In many respects, these teas more closely resemble greener oolong teas in color, flavor, and aroma because the oxidation is less complete than in most black teas. However, they are usually considered distinct from proper Darjeeling oolongs. First flush Darjeeling is considered a highly desirable tea, and can be very expensive, although the range of prices is broad. Broken-leaf, single-estate first flush teas can sometimes be less expensive than whole-leaf, mixed-flush, blended Darjeeling. Because the qualities of each tea depend on the climate conditions of the particular year of harvest, the batches can vary considerably from year to year. In contrast to darker black teas, which most companies recommend brewing with boiling water, some companies recommend brewing first flush Darjeeling teas, especially lighter batches, with water that has cooled somewhat from boiling, around 180°-190°F. Whether or not this is necessary can vary hugely from one tea to the next. Niraj Lama of Happy Earth Tea, explains that high grades of Darjeeling first flush work exceptionally well with cold brewing, which he explains on a blog post on cold brewing Darjeeling.',84.8,'Half-litre pot at home, made from a sample included in the tea company''s Advent Tea Calendar (2020) and consisting of fine Darjeeling leaves in all shades of green and some brown ones, too.

Review #106','A tricky-to-brew tea that reminded me a lot of green oolongs from Taiwan, and required a lower water temperature to brew to satisfaction. The dry leaf, quite broken, is an intense green color, like a lot of good Darjeeling first flush. It looks exactly like pictured in the company photo (I appreciate honest photography!) Very fresh smell, a slight hint of sweet malt and strong floral and vegetal notes, honey-like, very fresh smelling too. I love the smell and I''m excited to try this. The brewed cup has a delightful aroma, with floral and vegetal notes resembling green oolongs, and that characteristic Darjeeling grape-like fruitiness. Like with some of these oolongs, the aroma is also slightly soapy though. I was a little disappointed the first couple times I brewed this. I found that brewing temperature was the secret: this tea really cannot handle boiling water. It made a BIG difference...with boiling water, the tea had some off qualities, was oddly thin yet too bitter and also oddly sour, and made me feel a bit jittery after drinking it. I even went a little lower than recommended, brewing this more like a green tea, at about 180°F/82°C, and this produced good results. Brewed ideally, the aromatic qualities of the leaf came out more. The cup was still a little thin-bodied, but the bitterness and sourness were reduced and the cup tasted more balanced. On the strong side for me, caffeine-wise. I wouldn''t drink this one late in the day; it''s good if you want a bit of a kick. Resteeped well; the second cup was a bit thin-bodied but retained a lot of the fresh, vegetal and floral, oolong-like aromatic qualities of the first. This tea was pricey, but not compared to other first-flush teas of this caliber. The main reason I''d say this tea doesn''t offer the best value is that, to me, it''s competing with similar-tasting Taiwanese teas of a lower price that are easier to brew, produce more infusions, and are less caffeinated. If you like very green first flush teas, and especially if you are also a fan of green Taiwanese oolongs like Pouchong / Bao Zhong or very green Dong Ding, you might really like this one. Just be careful with the brewing temperature; it''s much pickier than an oolong.','With the most prominent notes being pineapple, cranberry, and lemongrass, this tea is almost like drinking tart fruit juice. I love it because of that, but I can see others disliking it for the same reason. I taste a bit of honey as well. First flush is stereotyped as floral, but I don''t get a lot of that here. There are some herbal notes, but they''re more in the background. This was the most expensive tea I got at The Coffee and Tea Exchange, and it was still only $3/oz. That''s a fantastic deal for tea this good.','I will likely revise this review after a few more times trying this tea. It seems high quality with a grassy quality, but I can’t decide how I feel about the bitter undertones. I generally am not a fan of bitter teas. To be fair, it might be a fault of my brewing. I do overall enjoy this tea, though, so long as it is drunk before it cools. Update: Keeping the steep time short really helps this tea. A little honey goes well with it, too.','Teavana','Happy Earth Tea','Harney and Sons','Happy Earth Tea','Teavana');
