Add 2 to 3 ounces (dry weight) of dolomitic limestone to 4 gallons (half bushel) of mix. For fluoride-sensitive plants, adjust the pH so it is no lower than pH 6.5. Superphosphate contains enough fluoride to cause foliar burn on sensitive plants. After sterilizing the soil, add 3 tablespoons of a 6-6-6 or another fertilizer such as 5-10-5 to each half bushel. Plastic-coated fertilizers also can be used; most of them require about 2 ounces per half bushel. Add a minor element formulation to the potting mix per the manufacturer's recommendation.");
